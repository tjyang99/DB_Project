       " 'review': [\"My copy of Sword and Shield came in the mail a bit early yesterday, and while Sword and Shield are pretty cute games, I have to admit there are some glaring problems that make this game feels like it was needed to bake in the oven a tad bit longer. For starters, I just want to say I never cared for the controversy surrounding these games about not being able to transfer all of your pokemon, so this review is in no way biased towards that. There are, however, other issues that did drag down the experience for me. I often ran into performance issues. Frame drops, trees or objects randomly popping up in view; and while at times the game does seem beautiful and comfy, at other points the game almost seemed sloppily put together.\\rThe games are far too easy to the point of boredom, even for a Pokemon game. I felt myself being overleveled very quickly. I was often taking down opponents only in one singular attack, despite not going out of my way to fight many monsters. The new EXP share, which spreads experience across your whole party, seems to amplify this problem. It seems as if the game was not balanced with this feature in mind, as my entire team were several levels ahead of our opponents for most of- if not, the entire game. The adventure lasted roughly about 12 hours for me to complete, which is awfully short for an RPG, and there isn't much you can do after the journey is over. Might I add this game only has 10 routes, previous entries having about 30ish.\\r I will not get into story spoilers in this review, but the games are a bit more linear than I was expecting. My main criticism stems from Hop, your happy-go-lucky friend and rival, who always seems to interrupt the flow. There is hardly a moment where you can walk around without being interrupted by dialogue or a cutscene by him or some other character. I audibly groaned whenever Hop appeared on screen. I do like a good story, but I would also like to be able to play through the game without my rival breathing down my neck. Trainer customisation in this game is something I appreciated. Customizing your character is the widest it has ever been in this series, complete with photogenic trainer cards that capture the essence of your character. I find this feature very wholesome and cute, with many expressions and poses to chose from.\\r I was looking foward to seeing the wild area being a reimagined safari-zone full of life, but unfortunately: it is large, empty, and barren. Models walk around a bit stiffly, and the textures are a bit dated and lackluster for a console game in 2019. Animations from this game can either be very well done, or extremely lacking. There was one instance where one of the major pokemon in the story mode didn't even have a turn animated for it's walk cycle. The pokemon's entire model was just rotated 180 degrees, which was very noticeable and bizarre. However, speaking of which, I do like the very diverse set of pokemon this generation. There are quite a lot that you are able to catch in the region, old and new; and they are all pretty unique and sometimes goofy in design.\\r The newest feature, Pokemon Camp, was very charming. I loved the animations in this mode, they were definitely at their peak here in terms of quality. It was quite entertaining to see my Scorbunny/Raboot play with the Feather Wand Toy I had. Pokemon in camp interact with each other and it feels very lively. Making curry was cute. However, I do have my problems with it. For starters, the AI for the pokemon can seem a bit buggy, where they might get stuck walking in one place. I can't say it's common but it did break the immersion a bit. There was one instance where I had no background in the camp at all, which seemed like a bug. But then I encountered a battle with a background very similar to this, and I can only assume it was intentional? At times, I almost felt there was more time and effort put into this side-activity than the actual battle system.\\r At it's core, it is definitely a Pokemon game. The basic formula of Pokemon works in these games. However, I was still disappointed, and I can without a doubt say that this is the least amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of a mainline pokemon game so far. Pokemon Sword and Shield fails to truly innovate despite being the first mainline entry on any type of console, and I cannot say that it is a sixty dollar Pokemon game at all. It feels rushed, poorly optimized, and half-baked. Can I see a child enjoying this game? Yes. Can I see a newcomer to the series enjoying this game? Possibly. Can I see a longtime pokemon fan enjoying this game? Not likely, unfortunately.\",\n",
       "  \"This is what happen if a company realize that they can do anything and people keep buying their products. Pokemon Sword and Shield are the worst mainline Pokemon game to date. Gamfreaks cuts more than 50% of Pokemon, removing moves, mega evolutions, and endgame contents without adding any improvement they promised. Most of the Pokemon model is proven identical to 3ds pokemon model which means they lied, because in the interview they said the reason they can't bring all the Pokemon is because they had to make all the models from scratch which is proven is not the case.\",\n",

       "  \"I really wish the games were good. I don't leave this review out of spite, but because I love the series. For the positives, I like some of the new designs. On top of that, most Pokemon get additional moves, giving them more variety in combat. Besides that, it's a Pokemon game with serious added flaws. Though it was a trend set in earlier games, the new games are more linear and less secret filled than ever. Dungeons are more akin to hallways instead labyrinths with branching paths and abundant secrets. There are very few routes in the game, and the ones that exist are mostly short and lack complexity. The wild area feels half baked and unfinished. After the short main campaign, all that's left for you is a short side story and a Battle Tower. Besides that, you're entirely reliant on playing online for content.\\r As a gimmick, Dynamax against other players is frustrating and poorly balanced. One wrong move and you're down two or even three mons. This is especially devastating in 3v3 matches, it feels even more poorly balanced than the previous battle gimmicks, Mega Evolution and Z-moves.\\r It's painful to see the series hit this low. I wanted this to be good, but wading through the major flaws to get to the small nuggets of good simply isn't worth it. The games aren't irredeemable, but it's really hard to recommend it when it drops the ball so hard.\",\n",
       "  'The critics calling Sword and Sheild \"the best Pokemon game ever\" are a bunch of delusional hacks. I want to start this review off by stating that I was excited for this game and desparately wanted the new formula to work well. Unfortunately, it does not work. What we have here is a diluted Pokemon experience that has been crudely adapted to be played by half-wits with the attention span of a Slakoth. The improved explorability and new features are little consolation to how lazily crafted and half finished this game feels. The missing pokemon are irrelevant when the game is such a stark downgrade in terms of quality, replayability, and explorability. The need to strategize has been all but eliminated and the game itself is largely linear. Gamefreak led us to believe that the controversial Pokedex cuts and gameplay revisions were done in the pursuit of making a triple-A quality \"Pokemon: Breath of the Wild\" type of experience. What we got, instead, is a 3DS game pretending to be a full-fledged console game. Nintendo can do better than this; Gamefreak and the Pokemon Company can do better than this; Pokemon fans can do better than this. There\\'s only trash here, folks.',\n",
       "  \"This game is a rushjob.\\r That said, not all things are bad, so lets start with the good:\\rThe core combat that has always been very enjoyable in pokemon is there.\\rI like the new minimalist UI during battles. Also, that there are more customizationoptions for your trainer and while the models are reused, there is no denying that the new filter(and that is literally all they did to them in terms of visuals and animations) makes the Pokemon look better than before! Lastly, they gave you more work arounds in terms of natures, EVs and IVs, which are appriciated(getting rid of IVs and Natures all together would be better, but let's be real, that ain't gonna happen in this life).\\r Now, for the bad, and holy hell, there is a lot of bad.\\r Personally, I don't care too much for the whole Dexit IF we got the promised upgraded visuals, but dataminers have already proven that most of the models and animations are simply ripped from the old game. But since those were blatent LIES, we lost half the Dex, Megaevolutions and Z attacks for NOTHING!\\r Then the new pokemon: Most of them look alright,  not too fond of the starters, the rest are ok but the legendarys are so lazy, they look like they should be part of the minor legendary trio, not the main cover legendarys!\\rAlso, let's not forget that they removed 144 attack moves, even some signaturemoves of pokemon that did make the cut.\\r The graphics got definitly improved for the pokemon and trainers(even though it is just a filter over the pokemon and slightly more details on the trainers), but they look downright trash for the rest of the game. Also, sooo  many battles don't have backgrounds, or backgrounds that are not fitting. You started a battle in a hotel lobby? guess what! you are now in a pure white featureless room!\\r Then the difficulty... I deffinitly am not one of the guys, saying that everthing should be hard as nails, but you shouldn't be able to oneshot every pokemon in the first 3 gyms, simply by walking through the game.(at this point, let me also mention that this is one of the shortest pokemon games ever, with barely any post game)\\r Gamefreak has been on an almost anual release cycle for years now, and the plattform upgrade is where this really starts to show. They need to take more time with the games and prioritize quality over quantity(nobody would have cared even half as much about the missing Mons if the graphics and animations really were  upgraded, I promise you that. Just look at Monster Hunter World, where they cut down the number of Monsters to 1/3 for World, but almost everybody agrees that it was worth it). Cause if this is the way pokemon games are from now on, then this will be the end of 20+ years of beeing fans for a lot of people.\",\n",
       "  'Let me just get this outta way first, I’m a massive Pokémon fan. I’ve never been more disappointed. Gamefreak not only betrayed fans but outright lied to consumers. The games still have the same problems plaguing the franchise ever since gen 6.\\r The story is bad, the writing is bad, the characters are bad, the pacing is bad. The main villains and evil team keep progressingly getting more embarrassing each generations. The game keeps getting easier easier easier literally brain dead play through.\\r On top of charging more for these games, they cut content. I don’t even need to write it down. I’m sure anyone who bothered to read the reviews of these games know what I’m talking about.\\r To all the people who keep supporting Gamefreak...why?',\n",
       "  'Let us address the elephant in the room first. The absence of the National Dex. Yes, it is terrible, lazy, blah blah blah. I am sure you\\'ve already heard this in hundreds of other reviews. So instead of me wasting your time by complaining about something you are already well aware of, I will focus on the rest of SwSh\\'s shortcomings. For reference, I have played every mainline Pokemon game to completion and have currently sunk 40 hours into Shield; I\\'d imagine my criticisms also apply to Sword. In the interest of brevity, I will be utilizing acronyms: (SwSh = Sword/Shield, S/M = Sun/Moon, etc).\\r The most succinct way to put it is SwSh essentially feels like a 3DS game ported to the Switch. This applies to every facet of the game: from its gameplay features to its visual presentation, to its story/characters. I believe whether or not you enjoy SwSh depends entirely upon how you view the 7th Gen games. Contrary to what the devs promised us last year, SwSh is most assuredly NOT meant for the \"core\" Pokemon fans. As a veteran of the series myself, I can say with certainty the abysmally low level of difficulty in conjunction with the simplification and outright removal of many features is the exact opposite of what I\\'d want. SwSh is nearly as simplified as LGPE, which wouldn\\'t be an issue if the devs addressed it as such, but somehow they seem to think this is what qualifies as a satisfying mainline game in 2019. Yes, Pokemon has always been a franchise aimed primarily at children. The games have never been truly difficult when compared to many of their JRPG contemporaries. Yet, for some reason Game Freak felt the need to crank that difficulty setting from \"Easy\" down to \"Braindead\". S/M may have been easy, but it was LEAGUES more challenging than Shield. Accessibility is one thing, but this is taking it to such an extreme it nearly removes all the fun. A \"Hard Mode\" option selectable from the outset would have worked wonders. And of course, as is common for the past several entries in the Pokemon series, the post-game content is practically non-existent.\\r So, SwSh basically fails when viewed purely as a \"game\", but what of the other aspects I mentioned? After all, JRPGs with subpar gameplay can still be surprisingly enjoyable if the narrative holds enough merit. I am sad to report that SwSh also completely fails in this regard. The writing is oftentimes so atrocious I\\'ve found myself wishing to skip these scenes entirely. This is par for the course as none of the mainline games (barring the \"attempts\" made in B/W) have really delivered anything substantive in the way of competent storytelling. However, with the majority of other Pokemon games, they at least had good gameplay to compensate for the lackluster story; a factor which is completely absent from SwSh due to its inherent simplified nature and toddler-pandering difficulty.\\r Well, there is only one thing left to discuss since delving into too much detail on the above points causes me to exceed the character limit. The final point of contention is the visual fidelity and graphical offerings SwSh brings to the table. This is after all, a game made for the Switch; a console/handheld hybrid with roughly 10x the computational power of Pokemon\\'s former home, the 3DS. Let\\'s get the pesky numbers out of the way first. SwSh runs at a dynamic resolution on both docked and portable modes. In docked mode, the resolution fluctuates from 1080p to 864p. Likewise, during portable play, the highest res is 720p which descends to 576p on frequent occasions. This is somewhat disappointing considering LGPE was capable of running at 1080p docked/720p portable at all times. The framerate target is 30fps, which exhibits frame pacing problems and severe drops in a variety of areas. The most evident manifestation of these issues can be seen in the Wild Area, wherein both pacing and framerate are pushed to their absolute worst. This is a massive problem considering the majority of your time, especially in post-game, will likely be spent in the Wild Area.\\r Aside from the quantifiable metrics highlighted above, there are plenty of other visual shortcomings to boot. Terrible terrain detail, awful textures, constant pop-in, stilted animations, low polygon count for both the human character models as well as the Pokemon, and countless other issues such as these result in a game that resembles something released over a decade ago. Many detractors claim SwSh looks like a PS2/GC game, which is definitely an exaggeration, but what we got is by no means acceptable for a non-indie game released in 2019. And yes, many of the animations and ALL the returning Pokemon models have been copy-and-pasted with negligible improvements for SwSh.\\r It\\'s one thing to sacrifice content for a more polished, higher quality game, but that is very clearly not what happened here. I genuinely hope these issues can be sorted out in future releases; I am not ready to give up hope on Pokemon just yet.',\n",
       "  \"The amount of reused content, technical issues and blatant incompetence that this game shows are by far the objective demonstration that this is the worst game in the series thus far.\\rHaving been a long time fan of the series i can't help but feel incredibly disapponited with its direction and decisions, from the removal of fan favourite pokémons (more then half of them) or the removal of important moves for the competitive side of the game, like Hidden Power or Return, to the introduction of mechanics that are unoriginal and uninspired like Dynamax and Gigamax, this game feel like a cheap copy and paste of Sun and Moon ported to the Switch with even less content and rushed to meet the holiday season time frame.\",\n",
       "  \"I wish this game was good, I really do. There are some positives: UI is fine and building a competitive Pokémon is now easy and intuitive.But there are a lot of bad things. Graphics are terrible, especially in the Wild Area with pop ups everywhere. Animations are horrible too, especially compared with past spin-off games. They said they cut the National Dex for high quality animations but that is a straight lie. It would have been fine if that was the case but it's not. The game is also very short and easy. The story is very simple. Very disappointing overall.\",\n",
       "  \"Despite the dexcut and graphical shortcomings I was aware of before playing, I was pretty hyped about this game, but turns out it's less of a package than even the 3DS games were that will cost you an extra 20 USD, compared to previous mainline Pokemon entries. It suffers greatly from a gimped, poorly paced storyline that doesn't give enough time for it's cast to shine and develop, aside from Hop, who is a carbon copy, down to several animations, of the last gen's Hau. The story itself is re-using a lot of tropes from the last mainline entry, and overall, while starting strong, feels rushed and shallow towards the end. Just as shallow as it's story is the game's world, the Galar region, featuring only 10 routes, 6 out of 10 of which are basically staright, fairly short lines that have little to no exploration to them or branching paths. The game features no traditional dungeons, and those locations that are intended to be them hardly ever have more than two branching paths. The most advertised feature of the game, the Wild Area, is a disappointing mess that showcases most of the technical issues with this game: the insanely small draw distance (which is an apparent issue even outside of wild area), questionable gameplay design choices and low resolution texutres and unstable framerate, coupled with the barren game world, lacking in detail or meanwhile content to do. But unfortunately, issues don't end there. More than 100 moves were deleted from the game, the abovementioned pokedex cut leaves out more than 50% of past generations pokemon, the postgame is incredibly disappointing and expects player to play competitively, meaning there is little to no single player content for a player to chew on. The new gimmick of this generation, Dynamaxing, has a promising theme - Kaiju-inspired giant monster fights, which, sadly, it doesn't live up to. The new pokemon designs and characters are charming and creative, but do not justify a 60 USD purchase in any way, shape or form.\",\n",
       "  \"Pokemon Sword and Shield boast expansive landscapes and a sense of ambition... at first. The more the game goes on you become aware of how hastily put together and hollow it really is.\\rThe main selling point, the Wild Area, is smaller than you would expect - and plain ugly to boot. There is not a lot to do there. The same games for the game's traditional routes which are some of the smallest and most linear yet. This combined with the game interrupting you every 5 seconds for Leon to brag about his Charizard or whatever make the game a chore to sit through despite their short length.\\rThat's not to say the game doesn't have it's positives though, Galar can be quite pretty when it comes to towns and colors, and there are some much welcome quality of life improvements like easily accessible move re-learners and nature mints. A lot of the series past tedium is now gone and getting into competitive has never been easier. The new monster designs themselves are also cool and imaginative. The dynamax gym battle are a sight to behold with their giant battles and roaring crowds. I also much prefer the new Y-comm to generation 7's festival plaza.\\r Unfortunately, that's about all nice I have to say about the games. The difficulty is nonexistent, the story is dull and predictable, and the overall content and variety pales compared to past entries despite them sacrificing 500 Pokemon and costing $20 more. These negatives as well as the technical issues and signs of a rushed game (an important battle has no music, last gym is a single room etc.) mean I can only give these a 4/10.\\r There is potential, but they need to spend more time on their products for something truly good. Better luck next game.\",\n",
       "  'At the beginning of the game, serious performance issues are already notorious. The game lags in certain parts and there are awkward moments where nothing is happening and you\\'re just waiting for a cutscene to resume. The handholding is unbearable and the Kanto-throwbacks are off the charts. Charizard will get praised half a dozen times before you can pick your first Pokémon. Hop is a cheap knockoff of Hau and thus the game breaks the long tradition of making every new rival unique in some way.\\r As the game goes on, you begin to notice that GameFreak engaged in false advertising. We were promised that the models had been remade from scratch. However, the meshes are the exact same in most cases. The few exceptions are models that got minor updates around the mouth area, presumably to eat curry. Some textures got updated but there are indications that the process might have been automated. Indeed, there isn\\'t even a distinction between, say, the eyes and the fur of a Pokémon. Instead, they look entirely like inflatable balloons. The animations, it can be shown, have been reused too. In that direction, even the game engine was demonstrably forked from Let\\'s Go. It\\'s too hard to see what is made \"from scratch\" in this game, as even the music is a remix of sample libraries from 2013.\\r The Galar region looks gorgeous in pictures but it has serious issues when you actually play it. The routes are small corridors without any intricacy. Even the wild area can be traversed in a few minutes. The forests and caves are not puzzling in any way. There is no sense of exploration or adventure. Many buildings are completely locked. The ones you can enter might look the exact same inside as they didn\\'t even bother to shuffle furniture around. Trees look like they were imported from the Nintendo 64. The berry trees in particular look completely out of place, as if they were from another game entirely; it\\'s really incredible that there was such a massive oversight and nobody raised an objection. There was no effort to make the water look good and the reflections are buggy. The grass and terrain textures are an eyesore. Walls and caves textures are straight out of the Sega Dreamcast. Weather is illogical and poorly implemented. You can \"ride\" trains but they didn\\'t even bother animating it as it\\'s just a black screen and you have magically teleported: even Gold and Silver had more effort into it. To top it all, time bizarrely freezes when you use stairs.\\r Instead of being allowed to ride your Pokémon, you\\'re stuck with a goofy bike that even works on water. Pokémon don\\'t have turn animations and they pop in and out of nowhere which is very awkward and breaks the immersion, defeating the entire point of overworld encounters. Then again, trees and people do it too. You are also not allowed to even throw a Poké Ball at higher level Pokémon so it\\'s hard to see what is the point of including them so early into the game. You can\\'t pet your Pokémon and the Pokémon Camp is an inferior version of Pokémon Amie and Refresh. The option to play with a ball is so poorly programmed that it\\'s hard to believe it passed the testing stages. In battles, big species like Wailord and Tyranitar are butchered by the downscaling algorithm. There are many bugs that are baffling such as trainers disappearing when certain attacks are used. We were promised this would be the game that long time fans had been waiting for but that seems extremely unlikely.\\r The story is dull, rushed and boring. Interesting side characters get little screen time. It\\'s obvious the story was not their focus this time. However, the game is not cohesive in any way so it\\'s hard to see what even was their focus this time. Indeed, there is very little content as there\\'s barely any postgame at all while the main story can be leisurely beaten in 12 hours assuming you aren\\'t the kind of player that loses to NPCs. Some towns have interesting themes but they are massively underdeveloped and the \"city\" surrounding the Battle Tower is peak laziness: it\\'s just a cardboard background. The region feels lifeless in general and the subpar method chosen to spawn people doesn\\'t help. Major features like the GTS were cut and simple features like volume control are locked under key items. The level scaling is very poor as you\\'re massively overleveled early on without any grinding, then there is a sudden spike in difficulty that can\\'t be accounted for, and finally you go back to being overleveled even if you skip optional battles.\\r In short, this game is awful for advanced players, mediocre for casual players and it\\'s desirable that this is nobody\\'s first Pokémon game, least they get the wrong impression. It is the worst Pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard Pokémon formula. Being understaffed isn\\'t even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games; GameFreak has serious leadership issues.',\n",

       "  \"Sword and Shield is a shameless, rushed cashgrab.\\rThese games are easily one of the biggest disappointments in 2019, and one of the worst JRPGs in recent years, and perhaps one of the worst switch games thus far.\\r The positives of SwSh are few, but they're there. For one, the moveset availability is a lot better since while it sucks to have the good attacks go back to the 1 use TM system known as TRs, at least moveset potential is still flexible.\\r The new pokemon is always a good addition to the ever increasing size of the amount of pokemon that well... would have existed.\\r SwSh also brings back the smug @sshole rival archetype that wasn't seen since Silver in gen 2 and it's remakes.\\r Yet these are a few compared to the few of many huge downsides below:\\r SwSh most common and biggest problem is the cut pokemon. You can't transfer any pokemon from previous games that aren't in the Galarian dex into the games. You have to wait for that potential cashgrab known as Pokemon Home as well. Plus you can't even inject, or even attempt to play as the missing pokemon. Only some of the ones not part of the dex are programmed in, and they're the starters and some legendaries. At least in gen 3, the missing pokemon were programmed in, and you could use gameshark to play with them.\\r SwSh also removes mega evolutions, and z-moves and creates yet another gimmick which is inferior, and more broken to the 2 separately. Dynamax and Gigantamaxing are poor gimmicks which only benefit the fast, and powerful mons. What it does is it increases the hp temporarily, and turns all attacks in dyna/giga attacks which are powerful attacks that each one has a secondary effect. All status moves turn into protect. Essentially a temp hp boost with z-moves, and it doesn't take up an item slot.\\rThis sucks since it just means that in game, the ace mons that are giga/dyna often die in very anti-climatic means, and in competitive play, these mechanics force the other player to utilize it to stand a chance.\\r Graphically, the game looks even worse than 3H. Water reflections are off, theres those infamous n64 trees, and the texturing is PS2 tier. Which is an honest to god achievement, how does a game manage to look worse than 3H on the same console. At least 3H has great gameplay, and decent story for the most part, SwSh has none of that.\\r The technical aspects, and animations of SwSh is truly atrocious. The games have hideous draw distance, and random FPS drops. the game that does ZA WARUDO whenever the player fishes, or climbs a ladder. Horrible graphics in general, terrible scaling especially for mons like Wailord and Tyranitar. The animations look especially bad on a lot of attacks. The infamous double kick animation, and even the important plot cut scene with the box art legendaries when they just turn around in place.\\r The GTS is also looking to be missing which is another huge downside, considering the GTS was pretty much a series staple, and to see it removed adds to the ever growing list of features GF introduces then throws out in the next gen.\\r The main story is really short, you could probably finish it in 8-10 hours, and the intrusive dialogue from S/M makes a return in SwSh, meaning the biggest problem with S/M is back again in these set of games. No you cannot skip the dialogue, only the actual cutscenes.\\r EXP Share is on permanently and is no longer a key item. This means that training up a low leveled will lead to your other mons being massively overleveled. Oh and for some reason sound settings are locked behind a key item which you have to get from a rather easily miss able NPC.\\r The post game is once again barren, perhaps even moreso than XY. You get 2 hours worth of post game, and it's mostly just going to the other gyms and fighting dynamax mons, and then fighting the box art legendaries. That's seriously it. Oh and you can do a gimped battle tower if you really wanted to.\\r The biggest crime of them all though. It has most of the flaws which I listed above, and it costs $60 USD. Yeah that's the same price as a triple A game, yet this game is basically a shovelware tier joke.\\r Seriously this is supposed Pokemon's mainline series debut on a console? This is what it has to offer? Nothing but pure disappointment, and a total step backwards from a 3DS game? The GC spin offs, and Wii's Battle revolution were a better taste of what a main series pokemon game on a console could have been.

This generation doesn't start well.

       "  \"This game is not worth your time or money.\\rI played through the game before launch. It's incredibly unpolished and lacking in content. Not only this, but the game has wiped my friend's downloaded games from their SD card.\\rThis game only includes roughly 400 out of the 900 Pokemon made up to this point. Yet they've reused the models and animations from the 3DS titles. They also cut out the GTS and over 100 moves. Online play is very shallow as a result. They put nothing in to justify the cut content. You're paying 50% more for half the content found in the 3DS games! I can't even recommend these games to parents with children who are fans of Pokemon. If they have any favourites that aren't in the game they will NEVER be able to use them. They are not programmed into the games. My heart breaks for these kids. If you do buy them for your kids, make sure they don't transfer their old Pokemon to Pokemon Home when it's released. They could be stuck there forever, forcing you to pay every in order to prevent them from being deleted.\\r The only improvements are the overworld encounters and they couldn't even get that right. The render distance of Pokemon is completely immersion breaking. Pokemon will appear out of thin air 4 feet in front of you.\",\n",

They used the exact same game models from the 3DS and they cut 455 Pokémon from the game for better animation and graphics even though it looks the exactly the same as it did for the past 7 years. I never thought GameFreak could get any lazier and incompetent than this. Generations 1-5 had more soul put into them than these games.

It\\'s not all bad, however, a lot of the new pokemon designs look great, but when one mon uses headbutt and the animation is it kicking and that same mon has double-kick with the animation of bouncing twice, you quickly realize the issues are only going to keep piling up.\\r Things such as trees, trainers, and pokemon pop in and out randomly because of the extremely short draw distance. You can also see this in the middle of battle, because some moves cause the opposing trainer to disappear. Another issue like this is some wild battles cause you to end up on an entirely different battlefield. You can catch a water pokemon on a dock in the center of a town and wind up in a huge open grassy field.\\r Pokemon are restrained to tiny plots of land by an extremely tiny invisible box and have a habit of teleporting and/or de-spawing for no apparent reason. This is most glaring in the \"wild area\" (an area of the game treated much more like an open world, with a free-moving camera) where it\\'s mostly devoid of life with the exception of grass patches and a few roaming mons that are still limited to a small area.\\r The level limiter in the wild area attempts to keep the game \"balanced\" by making it impossible to catch certain higher-level mons without having the corresponding badge, which begins at level 20 and increases by 5 after each gym win, but it totally removes the danger of attempting to catch something that could easily defeat an under-leveled team. The experience share always being on is another issue. While the exp. share itself is a good thing, the fact that it can\\'t be turned off is head-scratching. Previous games had the option to leave it on or turn it off for an adjusted experience. It\\'s a bit odd that they decided against that this time around.\\r Sword and Shield had the potential to really shine on the Switch, but it ultimately fails at improving anything of substance and relies on it\\'s, at times, pretty graphics while simultaneously asked a higher entry fee. Overall the game is a mess and I implore GameFreak, Nintendo, or The Pokemon Company to please look at the direction the series is going and make the right decisions going forward.',\n",

Apart from the Wild Area, there is very little to explore in this game. Routes are linear hallways designed to move you from A to B. The game's animations are very poor and for the most part recycled from previous 3DS entries. The rushed nature of the game is also very apparent after gym 5, as the game becomes extremely streamlined and the animations dip in quality substantially after this point. I would not be surprised to hear that this game was rushed out the door for the Christmas season.\\r Overall, the entire game can easily be completed in 12 hours, there is little to do after the end credits, and what you can do gets repetitive very quickly. While you play you will be faced with busy, grating music that will make you desperate to go out of your way to find the NPC that will allow you to MUTE it.

And there’s much more to the story than just Dexit. Worse graphics and animations, large content cuts, the game holds your hand and is more tedious with its constant cutscenes and bland story, and its limited locations along with very little post-game. If you want to get this game, good for you, but in my opinion, it just feels like one step forward, two steps back. Even the good additions isn’t enough to save it.',\n",
       "  \"A bigger let down than what I was expecting. Took me only about 10 hours to beat the game and only 9 hours for my sister. The battle animations were a lot more restrictive than I thought. The only highlight in animation is during the legendary battle. I was also disappointed to hear that many pokemon were cut for the sake of better animation and more content, only to realize there wasn't much of either. If the stuff about 3D models and animations being re-used from the last game is true, then that's even more disappointing since that would mean they had even more time to do things right if they were recycling assets. A lot of the pokemon designs this time around also felt really off, especially the water starter, Mr. Rhime and Dracovish, but that's more of a design critique rather than what about the game. The Dynamaxing ability was a pretty big let down as I was able to take out most of these powered up pokemon in one hit, including the Champion's. The difficulty in the game was a bit too simple. Usually I end up defeated at least 4 or so times in a Pokemon game or I at least lose most of my team in a hard fight, but this time around I just took out almost everything in one hit while not losing a single pokemon or needing to use more than a few items this time around. The world itself also feels incredibly linear for a Pokemon game that promised you an open world experience. Like most open world games, its also pretty barren, and most of the pokemon you encounter in the wild don't look or move in a lifelike fashion. In short, it was disappointing. Which is a shame since I was really looking forward to this.\",\n",
       "  'Pokemon has always been one of my favorite games, however, the design choices made by Gamefreak are rampant with this entry of the series. There are almost no routes in the game, and those that exist are linear. There is a town that is made up of a single road with the only door usable being to the Pokemon Center. There are no dungeons or caves of the sort, instead, the Wild Area tries to fill this role, but with many issues. It has poor graphics with Pokemon being birthed from the void to populate the area, as well as trees spawning from nothing. The area is empty and feels poorly thought out compared to other Switch games like Breath of the Wild. The removal of 60% of old Pokemon and 20% of old moves, as well as megas and Z-moves is also a disgusting practice which gives an ill boding for the future of the games. Gamefreak needs to seriously reconsider their design choices and patch in the many missing features (Pokemon, moves, GTS, etc.), as well as fix the many bugs such as those breaking SD cards, freezing the game, and causing unbearable amounts of lag.\\r Many reviews you see that are positive simply boil down to \"The games killed my wife and kids, but at least I can catch a Pikachu again. 9.5/10\" which is utterly disgusting and reeks of poor journalism or faux reviews to prop up the game for the less informed.',\n",

The world is so linear it feels like a hallway with a cutscene every few steps. The endgame is nonexistent. The battle animations are taken straight from the old games. And honestly, the new Pokémon designs are some of the worst I’ve ever seen. Most of them look like a couple overlapping shapes with a painted on face. GameFreak really phoned it in on this one. Time to give Pokémon to someone else.',\n",

But the wild area was suppose to be a trade off for little routes, but the wild area is fairly small. Pokemon in the over-world  don't interact with the over-world save for chasing after the trainer.  The weather changes in the wild area are way too sudden. And have the bike become the hm replacer is bad, should've sticked to how SM and LGPE did it. The routes are fairly short  and route 7 especially takes less than a minute to cross including trainers. The story is very bland. I don't expect much from Pokemon but after SM I at least wanted to interact with more personal stories characters had. There is no evil team in the game. Team Yell are just Marine fans who like to get in your way. Then turns out they are actually the gym trainers for the 7th gym, Piere's gym. Marine's older brother. It seemed Marine was gonna have a small story arc when we got to the seventh gym, but it was shafted after we beat Piere. The League got rid of the Elite Four and replaced it with a tournament. Not bad , it's execution in this game sucks because it's against Gym Leaders and characters you didn't really bond with. The twist in the game was Chairman Rose wanted to awaken a pokemon with infinite energy for dynamaxing. Dynamax energy runs out in 1000 years btw. He decides to awaken it during the tournament, we literally would've helped after the tournament. But he was too impatient to wait 1 day for a problem that wouldn't happen for 1000 years. The battle against Eternatus sucks, you don't fight whatsoever. The two box legionaries are the only one's that can damage him, and you don't even control them. You're just in the battle was picking whatever move, because it doesn't matter. YOU can't hurt him. After the battles the legionaries jump into the sunset, you don't get to catch one until post game. The game has so much potential, but it just fell flat for me.\",\n",

So what we have now is that we can’t transfer our old Pokemon and same animations. Less content- I personally don’t care about graphics if the game is good enough, but if you do... Well they are certainly ****- The game is kind of glitchy. I see objects, Pokemon and people disappearing- Frame drops, and it’s not like in Link’s Awakening when sometimes the game switches to 30 fps.

       "  \"Pokemon Sword (and by extension, Shield) is the newest mainline entry in the Pokémon franchise. The first console mainline pokemon game on a console, expectations are high and rightly so but does the game deliver? Simply: No, it doesn't.\\r You are transported into the colourful world of Galar, brimming with new Pokemon and offering a challenge much familiar to any seasoned pokemon trainer to become the most powerful pokemon master of the region. A big part of pokemon charm is its extensive world building which isn't really present in Sword. The large open seeming cities only contain a handful of places you can explore with buildings and areas deceptively giving the appearance of much more. It advertised a wild area, with over world sprites and new Pokemon encounters but for the most part is completely barren with graphical issues and only a limited range of pokemon to catch. Gone is the dream of catching 'em all with over half of the current Pokémon being cut from the series for the first time.\\r Stories in pokemon mainline games have never been praised for their brilliant writing but Sword and Shield pales in comparison to even the series' weakest points. The characters archetypes are painfully already overdone with previous games, with the rival being a direct copy in terms of personality and animations to the last. Characters such as Bede and Marnie although seem promising at start, don't really have story development and don't give the time for the player to relate or to grow attached to them. The evil team is also painfully irrelevant with them only appearing at the end briefly and Team Yell being more of an annoying backstop than anything. Alongside a rushed and confusing short post-game, SWSH is the weakest in terms of story so far. With love it or hate it pokemon designs, an array of graphical issues and issues such as digital download copies corrupting save data for other game and softlocking - I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone at this price.\",\n",
       "  'The very low score I\\'m giving these games might seem like a poor attempt at review bombing them, but oh no my friends, this is an actual review from someone who actually played the games and didn\\'t receive any dirty money to say something other than the truth. Pokémon Sword and Shield are possibly the worst Pokémon games to ever be made. For a fully priced 60$ game, they have less than HALF the content of any of the 3DS Pokémon core series games and nearly no redeemable features. In fact, one of their most notable \"features\" is the lack of more than half of the old Pokémon (a first for a series, hurray innovation!), which means there\\'s over 50% chance that your favorite Pokémon is not even in the code for these games. The cut in content also includes moves, some of which make absolutely no sense why they would have been left out.\\r The characters are mostly bland and uninteresting and some are carbon copies of previous characters from Sun and Moon. Those that aren\\'t usually don\\'t have a story or personality deeper than a sheet of paper, and their constant, pointless, overly enthusiastic interruptions make it feel like the game is asking you at all times to \"pretty please be excited\". The environments pale in comparison to other first-party Nintendo games on the console even if some admittedly had potential. You\\'ll eventually find yourself walking through the empty streets of London, as if the apokélypse happened the day before.\\r Let\\'s talk about models, animations, and performance, shall we? All of the Pokémon models are reused straight from the 3DS games, with some exceptions that were so slightly improved that you can\\'t even tell the difference in practice. This wouldn\\'t be a problem as the Pokémon community understands this is necessary to keep these games realistically doable. The problem is that the producers of the game claimed they were cutting the amount of Pokémon so they could focus on remaking the models from scratch for the Switch hardware and also improve the quality and expressiveness of animations. Oh boy, are those animations lacking in quality. The characters move in tank controls (even during cutscenes!) like we\\'re still in 2000. Even in the overworld, expect a lot of 180 degree turns while the walking forward animation plays. This is completely unjustifiable, but not something we would even care if only GameFreak had not called attention to it and used it as an excuse for the massive cuts that will severely damage the entire series. Pokémon models are not properly scaled in battle, and instead they give us an absolutely unnecessary and lame feature of \"Dynamax\" in which they suddenly discovered the scale slider exists in 3D software and decided to abuse it. The game struggles to maintain a stable framerate even tho it took Breath of the Wild the \"Godray & Foliage Overkill Woods\" and Smash Bros. \"16 Ice Climbers on Fountain of Dreams\" for the same to happen. The draw distance is laughable and glaring, you are sure to direct your eyes to the nearest Berry Tree popping in.\\r Difficulty-wise, the game is so easy that the biggest challenge will be not falling asleep while playing it, something that is amplified by the previously mentioned constant interruptions by NPCs. The soundtrack has a few good themes, but the rest is a cacophony of instruments desperately trying to grab your attention with inharmonious, generic and chaotic tracks. The only hype I got from this game was during the climax, which I shall not mention for spoiler reasons, where apparently they blew the entire budget and development time, and even that is an average experience when put into context with climaxes from other current games.\\r If after this entire review you still think this game is worth playing, be aware of the awful glitch (that somehow passed quality assurance) which can actually delete your other game\\'s save files from your console.\\rIt\\'s so obvious that this game was rushed out in this poor state to meet unrealistic deadlines and extract as much money as possible from a blind and passive fanbase that I\\'m baffled by anyone who defends it.\\r In conclusion, whether you are a Pokémon fan or wanting to become one, these are games you can easily skip and save some bucks. I dare to say Let\\'s Go Pikachu and Eevee are better games than these dumpster fires. If you truly want a good Pokémon experience play the 3DS games or, even better, the DS ones.',\n",

Candies to let you get grossly overleveled, further reducing the game's difficulty... and everything I've written up until now has failed to mention all the lies, cut content and general anti-consumer practices that went into making this game.

       "  'This is the first time that my disappointment was so great that I felt like a needed to write a review. Sword and Shield overall is bad. Like its new Dynamax mechanic, its all show and no substance.\\rLet\\'s start with the good points first since the bad ones greatly outnumber them.\\r-The only good points I can think of is that the game makes it easier to change the EV and IV of your pokemon. Previously invisible and tedious to control, there are now items that make it easier to make the perfect pokemon you want.\\r-Greatest trainer customization so far, although that\\'s to be expected.\\r Unfortunately that\\'s the only good thing about the games.Here\\'s a list of its bad points\\r-The game is graphically bad. It looks like a 3DS game only with a shiny coat of paint,or in this case filters and bloom, to distract you from that. Characters spin in place to turn, Pokemon float and hover endlessly, the animations are recycled from earlier games,  the battle animations are lacking in all departments.\\r-Characters and Pokemon suddenly pop into existence in front of you.\\r-The infamous Pokemon cut debate. Pokemon were removed from the game with no intention of them being added back. They promised a higher quality models and animations for it but that is clearly not there. Models are reused exactly the same with just higher textures, the models are off-scale, a lot of characters animations are reused and battle animations dont line up properly, e.g kicking to headbutt, the model just moving up and down with no movement to attack, fire and water attacks just coming out from somewhere on the model and not lining up with their mouths or wherever the attack is supposed to come from.\\r-The game is piss easy. Not that other pokemon games werent easy but they offered a challenge. It\\'s so easy that there is no gratification from winning. It is also very short.\\r-The pokemon designs are bad. Everyone has some designs they dont like but these ones just felt a whole lot of miss rather than hit. A lot of them are so overly humanoid and uninspired that they dont feel like pokemon. You cant just draw a human, replace it\\'s head and feet and call it a pokemon. A lot of them also feel like they were made just for the purpose of a joke and a pun. In the end the majority of the new pokemon feel like they were created as a singular cartoon character for a show specifically made to be likeable instead of being designed as members of a species of animals.\\r-The greatest problem is the immersion. Pokemon is a role playing game. Immersion is a great deal in these kind of games. Their goal is to make the player feel like they are part of their world. Sword and Shield problems, even some minor ones I didnt list, all come together to ruin it.\\r--The new Open Area feels like a mismatch, Pokemon suddenly appear from underground even if it makes no sense for them to do that, they spin in place and their movement does not sync up with their walking animations, they hover instead of moving. Crazy weather patterns 10 steps next to each other dont make sense.\\r--The overworld pauses in time when traversing the Z axis.\\r--The jump to 3D wasnt kind to pokemon. The routes are so linear that they railroad you to place. From the 3D vantage point you can see whatever is up ahead removing any dungeon-like challenge. You are railroaded in place by knee-high ledges that act as barriers leaving you only to imagine what the rest of the world is like, out of the tiny path you are forced into.\\r--The world is small and empty. In earlier games you could interact with a lot of stuff, books, people, tvs and more. They gave you tidbits on the story, the background or even just gossip. This made the world feel alive. Instead in this game, a lot of it is removed, which along with the small railroaded world make the world feel dead.\\r--The battles feel off, as said before the pokemon are off scale and their attack animations dont line up properly. The bad animation are even shown in the new camp feature allowing you to see up close items suddenly appearing in your pokemon\\'s hands and their movement not syncing up with their walking animation.\\r--Bad textures.\\r--No \"dungeons\".\\rAll of these could be insignificant on their own but combined they ruin the feeling of immersion. The world feels fake, hurriedly stitched together and bursting at the seems.\\r In the end, Sword and Shield had great some great ideas but even those are not fleshed out properly. Instead of moving the games forward it even took steps back. The first home console release of Pokemon deserved better than this shoddily put together cashgrab.\\rBuy something else and if you want your pokemon hit, play the old games because you are not missing anything of worth. Let\\'s hope the developer goes back to the drawing board and stays there for quite a while.',\n",

These games used to have dungeons and mysterious places to explore, but that's all been removed in favor of boring corridors and unthreatening, short routes between towns.  Any credit I can give to this game is for some of the designs of the new pokemon, otherwise I can't stand it.

It does not do anything exceptional or ground breaking and it is another entry that coasts off the brand name.

The story suffers from the same issues as sun and moon where it truly doesn’t feel like your characters story which defeats the point of it being an rpg. The draw distance is genuinely abhorrent and further shows that gamefreak have shown themselves to be incompetent game developers. The game is ridiculously easy and “streamlined” which in this case means dumbed down. The game is short only being around 14-17 hours long which is a ripoff. Most industry standard rpgs range between 60-80 hours long while sword and shield is only a fraction. The graphics are bad there is no other way of putting it, they are low poly and the texture are hilariously low resolution. The colors are washed out and this looks like someone first attempt in unity trying to make a game. You have to compare this game to other games in the industry, gamefreak needs their feat held to the fire and should no longer be allowed to coast off the Pokémon name.

Speaking of environment, the places you can traverse are just depressing. The wild area advertised as a step in a new direction is a complete joke. It's certainly smaller than Oot's Hyrule field, yet just as empty and uninteresting. Cities and Dungeons on the other hand are just poorly designed hallways that lead you to the next area.\\rGameplay is not well thought out. The new gimmick is underwhelming at the very least. They build it up high and it ends with an anticlimactic ohko, since this game still possesses baby-proof difficulty despite the playerbase being mostly adults and the advertising claiming it's for long time fans. Contrary to being an open world, this game is still a linear experience with NPC's still interrupting you with cutscenes.\\rThe amount of content in this game isn't bare-bones, no rather it is insufficient and has regressed compared to previous entries in the franchise. Surely you've heard by now about cut pokemon, cut moves and other trashed content.

And that’s the for the outer world animations, when it comes to faces it’s even worse.  The textures themselves also appear to be from a game that is way past its expiration date.Graphics aside, the game is abysmally easy with the developers holding your hand from beginning to end.

There even is yet another save corruption glitch in these games, and it isn’t like talking to 1 NPC and surfing on specific tiles either.Even looking past the glitches, the main story is insultingly easy, even for children. The only places children can explore are in the wild areas and they are filled with nothing of interest (besides more examples of a lack-o-polish). Your kids might also be scared of the Camp feature since their Pokemon can do weird and unintended things. I personally also didn’t like being limited on what I could catch based on Gym Badges as I (and your kids) could easily lose out on a Pokemon they wanted to catch, and you are overleveled anyways.I’ll give the game some points though. While many designs are pretty sub-par, most of the new Pokemon are very well designed.

If you explore too much (by the way, there's practically LESS to explore than Sun and Moon), you wind up grossly overleveled for whatever sense of a challenge the game tries to throw at you. If you don't explore to try and stay within the right level range, you just rush through the game even quicker because, surprise, surprise, you'd still probably be overleveled anyway.

A change in expectations - either deliberately or unconsciously; sudden, or as a result of multiple experiences - can result in radically contrasting impressions of the same underlying video game.  With that in mind, it begs the question: what are reasonable expectations to have for a game like Pokémon Sword and Shield? What should we use as the baseline for forming these expectations?\\r The level of quality, polish, depth and amount of content in previous main entries in the series?\\rThe relative quality of alternative $60, 1st party Nintendo Switch titles?\\rThe hardware capabilities of the Nintendo Switch relative to previous handhelds on which Pokémon has appeared?\\rThe certain level of production value one might anticipate in a watershed moment for the highest grossing media franchise of all time?\\r These are all perfectly fair and reasonable baselines from which to form one’s expectations of Pokémon Sword and Shield. Nostalgia, goodwill and sentimentality for this particular series have seemingly always resulted in an expectation discount of sorts, but for many the 50% price increase for this installment, outright lies from GameFreak and the non-stop, in-your-face Kanto exposure in recent years have all but eliminated said discount. The unfortunate reality is, that even with a discount of sorts on expectations, Pokemon Sword and Shield still fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline.\\r Content removal has reached a fever pitch, and what remains lacks effort, ambition, or even a semblance of challenge. Since its transition to 3D, Pokemon has gone from mildly challenging to downright patronizing. In an era where Mario, Zelda, Fire Emblem and Super Smash Bros. have displayed radical ambition in their main Nintendo Switch entries, pushing their respective series’ to new heights…Pokemon Sword and Shield are aggressively mediocre. With the transition to console – from 4GB cartridges to 32 GB cartridges – from 240p to 1080p – that we even had such confusion and debate regarding the re-use of models, animations and textures is a tragedy. While a novel could be written on the business inner-workings of GameFreak and The Pokemon Company, having standards for their products - especially given their capacity to produce good ones when they try - does in no way make one entitled.\\r So it bears repeating: Pokemon Sword and Shield fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline.\\r Much to its detriment, Pokémon Sword and Shield offer substantially fewer features, shallower depth, and reduced challenge relative to earlier, cheaper Pokémon games on weaker hardware. That is the brutal reality of these games. If one is completely new to the Pokémon series and does not possess any level of – and here is that word again – expectation for these games, this might not matter quite as much, but will still worsen the overall experience if they have had even a taste of the Nintendo Switch’s JRPG contemporaries (XenoBlade, Dragon Quest 11S and Atelier, among others). For series veterans, especially those who have experienced the relatively ambitious, content-loaded, reasonably-challenging, generation 3-5 games, it will be hard for Pokemon Sword and Shield to block criticism of its cut content.\\r Again, by any reasonable baseline of expectations – which I list at the beginning of this review – Pokemon Sword and Shield fall woefully short. It’s painful to say and type that, along with everything else I have. What is even more painful however, is the reality that these games will likely be an enormous commercial success based on name recognition and have already received critical acclaim from the corporate critics and “content creators”, both of which are subject to an insidious conflict of interest when assessing the quality of these games. Said success will only incentivize low-effort, unambitious annual releases.\\r You will see many negative reviews here, none nearly as lengthy as my diatribe. However, recognize that these negative reviews, like mine, come from a place of love and passion for the Pokemon series, and a sense of heartbreak and betrayal over seeing what it has become. To us, we love Pokemon, and in order for it to improve, there needs to be a place for criticism. This is it.\\r Anyways, do not buy Pokemon Sword or Shield.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate? The gang\\'s all here, need I say more? Pokémon Sword and Shield? A cheap, glitchy, heartless, featureless cash-grab. And now reports are coming out that the game is corrupting people\\'s save files for all their other games, which is just the cherry on top of this joke of a game.Gamefreak has a long way to go to redeem themselves in the eyes of their fans. The sad thing is, I\\'m not sure they even have it in them. Even with all their vast resources, this is the Pokémon game they made. The time constraints were largely of their own making, as they failed to take on more staff, while taking on additional projects dangerously close to this game\\'s release. They\\'re just an incompetent studio, and the rot starts at the very top with Masuda and Ohmori. Nintendo should have wrested control of this franchise out of their incompetent hands decades ago. The fans have weathered so much of gamefreak\\'s incompetence and mediocrity over the years. We all deserve better from this franchise we love.',\n",

The textures and overall look of the game outside of a couple of flashy models and animated moves are laughable compared to other games on offer and even Pokemon games in the past. The issue of cutting the National Dex is also a major red flag as one of the best things about Pokemon was being able to have the same ones with you from game to game but obliviously a lot of people will no longer be able to do this but the important thing to stress is that even with this feature cut, the game still feels bad and shallow compared to other entries in the series so the excuses they offered that the rest of the game would benefit from the culling of the National Dex has failed to materialise in my view',\n",

       "  \"Aside from the most polarizing controversial decision ever made in the Pokemon History in not allowing to transfer many pokemons you've caught by only permitting the ones seen in Galar region in, there are several other flaws on this game that just makes it really frustrating and not worthy only playing for people expecting a more robust pokemon adventure. The game feels at many times incomplete, lacking in many areas as seen from many of the buildings and specially large landmarks such as a church not being able to enter, cities being just large corridors with its really usefulness being the pokemon center and the gym.\\r The change into a very linear game and the large amount almost empty cities hurts the charm of it. Your rival interrupts you several times and the amount of cutscenes is comparable to Sun and Moon if not larger. You can skip movies, but cutscenes are not skippable(except the tutorial one). The linearity increases when you realize routes are just corridors and there are essentially NO dungeons in the game. There are caves but nothing with a more or equal complexity like Mt. Moon, Rock Tunnel, Silph Co. Mt. Coronet etc. There is not even a Victory Road in the game.\\r Another point I want to touch is the Wild Area, which is the biggest main feature in the game. The Wild Area just as the trailers showed and I have experienced; is a large slob of terrain with open camera and its own weather system (that tends to change quite abruptly). You can meet several pokemons in there (many of them are very high level, which you cannot catch until you have a gym badge for its equivalent level). The problem with wild area is that it's rather barren, with not much to do besides catching some pokemon and doing max raid battles. While going around the wild area, at times it laggy just as if there were some frame drops( and even worse if you go online with your friends there) the pop up distance for pokemon is very short, so a lot of times pokemons and berry trees can pop at a point blank distance or extremely close from your location which is pretty jarring and it can have you unwillingly bump into them.\\r There are many other aspects I've disliked on this game, but in overall it's just your normal pokemon experience, a new region, new pokemon to find except there is much less to do than previous entries and there is not much to do post game.

       "  \"While there are a lot of things I really enjoyed about Sword & Shield, I also feel it's one of the weakest in the series to date. As someone who's played pretty much every Pokemon title multiple times, I absolutely, thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay that Sword and Shield did offer, because, well....Pokemon. However, that's also the first and largest problem with these new installments. The amount of gameplay. Not only is there not a lot of it, having one of the shortest storylines of any game, but what you did get is more than a bit lackluster. The story felt generic, the villains weak and forgettable, and the various sections of story felt extremely fragmented and weirdly juxtaposed. Whereas most of the games up until now had several hours of plot outside the main gym/pokemon league challenge revolving around evil corporations or various crime syndicates, this one.....had three different and unrelated groups, none of whom stuck around for more than like 15 minutes? Not to mention were entirely unremarkable and kinda pitiful, both as characters and as attempts at storytelling. Additionally, the gameplay not plot-specific in Sword & Shield felt fairly empty. Too much was done for you in these games, making the experience overall feel exceptionally....empty. No HM's/outside of battle pokemon moves, an integrated, immutable exp share that came at the start of the game with no challenge, constant hand-holding by NPC's, and a map that is vastly smaller than even some of the earliest games (the wild area being a bright point though). The games just felt kinda hollow.\\r Secondly, the leveling/grinding mechanics in this game are largely broken. Between the aforementioned exp share issue, and the constant rain of exp boosters from the wild area, the games became pretty broken extremely fast. While I appreciate the attempt to change the grinding mechanic from how it used to be (especially since the grinding mechanic in previous games made them far less playable/enjoyable after the main storyline concluded), this was a poorly thought-out effort. With barely an hour spent roaming the vastness of the wild area, my starter made the jump from lv 18 or so to well into the lv 50 range, making the rest of the game a joke. And mind you, this was before so much as reaching the first gym. While one could argue that simply not playing the game that way would solve that issue, the player shouldn't rewarded with an empty gaming experience just for using the mechanics and features presented in the game. Really, I was just disappointed with the ease of the game once I'd finished the wild area. A system for leveling up that doesn't take quite as long as previous generations, but is more fun and rewarding, and ofc challenging, than having exp boosts rained on you is desperately needed.\\r Some other small cons to these games:\\r -Unremarkable graphics. While superior to any of the DS/handheld games, the graphics were only SLIGHTLY better than Wii pokemon games such as Battle revolution, which came out over 10 yrs ago.\\r-Battle tower was probably the least inspired yet. Really generic.\\r-Virtually nothing to do postgame (after only 25ish hrs), unless you really love the Battle Tower.\\r-Low level enemies/rivals. I know this one applies to most pokemon games, but still. There need to be more challenging enemies to fight around or after the endgame point. How hard would it be to add some lv 100 trainers in an optional side plot? Or a hard mode at least?\\r-Generic legendaries.\\r-Terrible boss fights (super hand-holding)\\r-No Global Trade System. Why?\\r Good Points:\\r -The new random encounter mechanics were super fun! Loved being able to sprint through the grass and choose which pokemon I wanted to encounter. Excellent mechanic!\\r-Adding on to the previous one, the concept of very tough looking pokemon was really fun, and made for a really exciting/motivating sneak peak of late gameplay.\\r-The wild area overall was the single best part of the game. One or two more such areas filled with a lot more trainers and activities would have improved the experience, but nonetheless, an excellent addition.\\r-The dynamaxing was fun, though could have been expanded a lot more. The trainer version, for example, never involved shields, which was pretty anti-climatic.\\r-Water bike, fossil pokemon (kinda? super limited), camping, breakable TM's (TR's), skippable tutorials.\",\n",
       "  'The cutting of Pokemon was a change that I had expected (albeit dreaded) to come sooner or later as the series total Pokemon and alternate forms would continue to grow, I have never had an interest in the competitive landscape or catching every Pokemon so the reveal of the decision was disappointing to me, but somewhat understood. However I still believe this was a poor decision given that this is the first mainline Pokemon game to be released on a console, this is a big moment for the series and should have been taken far more seriously. I also believe that with a sacrifice this major, something of similar or greater value must be given in return. The cutting of Pokemon could have given Game Freak the opportunity to greatly develop the animations and personalties of the Pokemon kept in the game, perhaps reintroducing following Pokemon or having more dynamic interactions with them. Alternatively, the story and world could be more developed and based around the Pokemon that inhabit the region. Or the graphical prowess of the development team could be shown in the environment, with their time being spent on designing a more interesting world instead of reworking the Pokemon.\\rUnfortunately, none of this came to pass. While it is undeniable that the visual design of the game is better than what has come before (with the exception of some poor texture mapping on trees and rocks) I and many others do not believe that it has reached an acceptable level given the superior hardware the games are using. The games feel like an upgrade to Sun and Moon but lack the style that made Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee visually pleasing and still have some incredibly poor textures. Not to mention, the animations for the game have been shown to be reused and to freeze whenever a player climbs a ladder. For a game that had 3 years of development (1 for concept and 2 for production) and is charging £60/$60 at launch (going up against Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey) combined with being a part of the most profitable series in the world, this is completely unacceptable.\\rBut the biggest and most insulting aspect of these games is Game Freak’s dishonest marketing of the games, only serving to further stoke the flames between the developers and consumers. Not only did Game Freak avoid mentioning the cutting of previous Pokemon until being directly questioned about it by a reporter and later confronted by the angered fan-base, they have also provided blatantly false reasoning for why the cutting was necessary. The studio claimed that the cutting of previous Pokemon was due to them being forced to remodel them for the new hardware, however this was shown to be a malicious lie by data-miners, who discovered that they were re-using the previous models. This also brought their statement that the reason for the cutting of 50% of the previous Pokemon, mega evolution and Z moves was to improve the online and competitive matches into question, with many people believing that these features were cut either out of laziness or as a result of trying to release a new game every year since 2016 (I personally believe the former). While the re-use of previous models is accepted as an industry standard and shouldn’t be criticised, blatantly lying to consumers about your product should never be excused.\\rBut even with all of the controversy aside, the games still fall short even as Pokemon games. There is very little experimentation, with many of the story elements being reused from Sun and Moon (such as the fake evil team, the main mechanic being the result of a powerful Pokemon radiating a mysterious energy and even many of the character design sharing similar design elements to those seen in previous games). Most of the new elements of the game, such as dynamaxing, feel hollow and meaningless as they were clearly created with the intention of being abandoned next game rather than being included out of a genuine passion to develop and improve on the mechanics of the previous games. No effort was taken to improve on the storytelling of the series (which suffers from an overabundance of cut-scenes) or the difficulty curve (which is pathetically easy), showing a huge disconnect between the studio and their fans.\\rThe only area of the game that warrants praising is the soundtrack, which is of excellent quality as always and deserves a large amount of praise for the variety of styles and use of soundscapes in some of the tracks.\\rUnfortunately, even if you are a hardcore Pokemon fan, their isn’t much this game offers to warrant it’s £60/$60 price. I don’t even believe that £30/$30 wouldn’t be acceptable. I would recommend giving this game a skip, Game Freak should not be rewarded for poorly managing a project and producing a lackluster product (whether by intention or not). By not buying these games, we can hopefully encourage them to produce a better quality game next time.',\n",

       "  \"Just like most other Game Freak games, one step forward costs two steps backwards. In our case, the first step backwards might be the fact that the national dex and thus intergenerational 'mon ownership are pretty much dead - without ANY WILL to FIX THAT through an UPDATE! - and they want to you to buy a SCAM called Pokémon HOME until your favorite mon eventually gets into a new game if you're lucky. But let's talk about the games themselves... once again, the difficulty is nonexistent. By that i mean nonexistent to the point that it takes kids for idiots - you're basically constantly overleveled without even trying. And there's no hard mode to justify that. (in previous games, you could disable that item that gives exp to the whole party to prevent the overlevel, but you can't even do that anymore)\\rAnd the game is a wild ride of bad decisions, like locking the SOUND SETTINGS behind a key item. . Also just like Sun/Moon again, the game constantly annoys you with unskippable dialogs every new route or town. I mean, the dialogs really aren't the problem, but if you intend to play this game again, not being able to skip them will quickly annoy you. We're talking about a fastforward/skip buttons, something about as normal as saving your game! I won't go too much into spoilers, but this game prevents you from catching a certain Pokémon, while Heartgold/Soulsilver allowed you to catch it in a similar situation back then. It may be a bit frustrating for anyone to see this happen.  (also, yeah, it's true, sometimes NPC pop out of nowhere, i'm not really annoyed by that, though)\\rThat being said, the game has good to it. The max raid battles are quite fun and feel like actual bosses (more than the Totem Pokémon from Sun/Moon), and the game is an improvement in some aspects, like the intro of gym leaders battle, which feels really smooth. Or the fact that you can now skip the catching tutorial if you catch a mon with the few balls that are given to you at the start.\\rI hope you'll have more fun than me if you do get it!\",\n",

Animations look so stiff and outdated, why does the world freezes around me while I fish or climb ladders? Why are some background battles just white voids when even the Let’sGo games had that right? The textures quality is all over the place too, the worst ones are in par with Nintendo64 and the best ones are 3DS quality, but please don’t forget that this is a Switch game.\\rThe camping is quite cute actually but shallow, pokéjobs are ok but forgetful just like the whole dynamax thing is just a gimmick, the wild area looks like the main selling point this time but it’s just meh, a nice idea but really poorly executed and with almost no exploration after the first full run, the world is pretty much a straight line, there is no kind of exploration, do you remember places like Mt. Mortar, Seafoam Islands or Whirl Islands? There is nothing like that here, the most dungeon-like exploration you will get is something like Viridian Forest and it never gets more difficult than that.\\rThe game difficult is non- existent like the post-game, also why is the exp.share mandatory? Give us more options, don’t take them away...\\rI don't even care about the lack of National Dex drama, but I do understand why people are upset about it, also the National Dex was cut with the excuse on delivering better animations and a more carefully crafted game but the overall game polish is worse than ever, plus lots of other cut content, the quality of the game is 100% more important than not having all the Pokemon for sure. I would rather have a high quality game with 100 Pokemon than a stinker with 1000 Pokemon. When will we get battle animations like Pokémon Battle Revolution? Aren’t battles the main selling point anyway? We shouldn't be here comparing animations from OG Pokémon Stadium (1998) with Sword/Shield, yet here we are, how is this acceptable!? This is Pokémon they have deep pockets they can make it, hire or outsource more people if you need.\\rI am not going to talk about the new pokémon designs since that is a subjective opinion, but I quite like Dragapult.\\rFor me pokémon peaked with HG/SS and the highest point of its ambition was BW/BW2, Pokémon Sword/Shield feels and looks like a rushed game, it needed that extra year and more ambition to become something special...\",\n",

Speaking of big features one of the main selling points of this game was the dynamax battles, however these get much too easy very quickly it feels like this was an idea they threw in at the last second as the game doesn't really seem to be designed to facilitate these battles, the mandatory xp share allows you to level up rather fast early in the game making raid battles and gym battles feel like fighting a weak route 1 pokemon. While camping with your pokemon and making curry can be fun for about ten minutes I don't really understand why it exists other than to look at cute creatures when you're bored of what the main game has to offer, which isn't much. Most pokemon games I've played throughout my life I've managed to get enjoyment out of for at least 100 hours, after playing this game for 20 I felt I had seen everything it had to offer.

Every mainline previous entry in the franchise has always gripped me with an endearing world and cast of imaginative critters. But I feel that magic has vanished with the newest entry. I have to be honest,  the feeling of emptiness has to do with the fact that Pokemon as a franchise will no longer feel progressive. The design choices made for this game to remove older pokemon and the fact this will supposedly continue with entries in the future has genuinely dampened my enjoyment of the games. Without the sense of lasting progression, now pokemon sword has to stand as an rpg game on its own since it no longer will connect directly with the other entries, but the game itself is just a passionless, brainless chore. The battles against trainers feel like a chore, since the challenge is somehow even less than before as my pokemon are much over leveled without much effort at all from me. I was hoping to feel something when I got to dynamax my pokemon for the first time at a gym, but again it just felt like an auto-win button and didn\\'t require any challenge, thought, or excitement. People have told me that something like this was inevitable to happen for the franchise because it couldn\\'t sustain everything forever. I guess they also failed to mention that when it did happen, it was also the death of the franchise for me. There are vastly superior rpg experiences out there in combat, story, and excitement overall, made much more obvious now that what made this particular franchise stand out at all is gone.

       "  'Pokémon Sword/Shield are fun, fresh, new Pokémon experiences. You can catch nearly one-hundred new creatures, explore never before seen towns and cities, and interact with a colourful cast of new characters. However, the same can be said for every new Pokémon generation in the history of the franchise, and for perhaps the first time ever, the cuts and flaws really start to bring the experience down.\\r Through two decades of handheld releases with the same formula, the question was always there: “what if?” What could Pokémon look like, what could the series achieve, if finally freed from limited handheld hardware and brought onto modern home consoles?\\r As it turns out, the answer is more of the same. And that is exactly the problem.\\r Sword/Shield are a graphical upgrade from their 3DS predecessors, yet still look mediocre for their hardware. They offer plenty of new features, at the expense of everything new introduced the previous generation. They promise a new experience, yet have less content than DS and Gameboy Advance games released 10-15+ years ago.\\r It could be argued that Sword/Shield are a product of Gamefreak’s shifting design philosophy. Since 2013’s X and Y, franchise leaders have made it clear that accessibility is a priority. Case in point, 2014’s ORAS famously removed Pokémon Emerald’s Battle Frontier because “kids would get frustrated with the difficulty”, completely disregarding the millions who grew up with the games regardless.\\r This mentality is present in every aspect of Sword/Shield, actively removing player-choice in many situations. They are arguably the most linear games in the franchise: outside the Wild Area, you’ll be moving from A to B, with a noticeable lack of traditional “dungeons”, various inaccessible areas and major plot points happening off screen. Even worse, the EXP-Share is no longer optional. To many, it was a major factor in XY and beyond being far too easy, resulting in the player often being over-levelled for major battles, and its removal limits player choice for no good reason. By focusing on simplicity and linearity, Sword and Shield are easier and shorter experiences that feel less like adventures and more guided tours.\\r But now comes the main event: Dexit. You are finally unable to “Catch ‘Em All”, with roughly 500 creatures unable to be transferred into Sword/Shield. Disregarding forcing players to use a (likely paid) service to store Pokémon in the meantime, improved visuals were specifically cited as the reason for this decision. Sadly, that simply isn’t true. Sword/Shield look mediocre for their hardware, in many cases lacking simple details such as battle backgrounds and decent textures. Furthermore, many animations and models are outright reused, and while it isn’t confirmed if Gamefreak lied about “new models”, it’s indisputable that a AAA title in 2019 shouldn’t look this poor, especially if visuals are used to justify shortcomings elsewhere.\\r However, perhaps Sword/Shield are expansive enough to justify the cut content? Sadly, this isn’t the case either. Sword/Shield are roughly 15-20 hour games, average for the franchise, and offer significantly less post-game content compared to many previous instalments. Sword/Shield cost $20 more than previous Pokémon experiences: console prices, but nothing about the formula, length or content volume reflects that. New features like the Wild Area are fun, but every new Pokémon game in history has brought new features to the table, and nothing about Sword/Shield particularly screams bigger or better.\\r Sword/Shield are undoubtedly fun games. But to many, they’re also indicative of a stagnation that has plagued the franchise over the past five or so years. Sword/Shield are on a home console, but downgrade the graphics and they would be indistinguishable from any 3DS Pokémon release. Sword/Shield are the fourth consecutive yearly Pokemon games, and unfortunately don’t even stand out from the pack, let alone compete with games like Breath of the Wild and Smash Ultimate. In 2019, on the most powerful hardware yet, the bare minimum simply isn’t good enough anymore.\\r When your game offers less content than DS releases from 2009, that’s a sign things need to improve.',\n",

For example, the battle backgrounds not always matching up with battle. The quality of life changes were very welcomed but the EXP Share was still too strong and could not be turned off.\\r I must also add that the soundtrack was very forgettable this time around which is strange for a pokemon game, the postgame is also extremely short with it only being about 1-2 hours long. The battle tower makes a return but it's been stripped down to it's bare bones.\",\n",
       "  'The story is very lackluster. The story is also very short being only 15 hours. The post game is also very lacking because the cities are very narrow and their are less Pokémon to catch and train. The wild area was fun it is about the size of 2 regions in breath of the wild which is nice but it starts to feel small when you explore it for a while. The new dynamaxing feature is very lame it only makes the Pokémon bigger and even the giganticmaxing is also lame it hardly even changes the Pokémon. It is basically just a Mega Pokémon with every attack as a zmove. It is a Op gimmic it basically makes the Pokémon indestructible for 3 turns and all your moves one shot everything. Luckily though you can’t use this gimmic when every you want unlike megas and z moves because of how broken it is which is good. But not being able to use the gimmic when ever feel restrictive. Around 60 percent of Pokémon were taken out of the game which runs n the competitive more because it restricts the variety of Pokémon you can use and mix up your team it limits you to the Pokémon that is available in the game. Which doesn’t help give a chance for other Pokémon to shine because no one is going to use a Pokémon just because their is less to pick from there are just going to use their favorite.  The lack of Pokémon also shortens the post game because there is less Pokémon to catch. They said they did it to improve the graphics but the graphics are nearly the same just more polished up what they should have done was redone the animations like the double kick move they should have at least made the Pokémon move to the Pokémon and actually kick instead of showing to feet on the enemy Pokémon. Removing the Pokémon to balance out the competitive is also dumb because we can just ban the Pokémon from use or only let certain Pokémon be used in tornment like ubers only or RU Pokémon only. Not only that megas and z moves were removed from the game which is a much better, more balanced, and cooler gimmic. The enemy team is just a remake of team skull but worse. Instead of being a bunch of gang kids with Guzma as their leader now it’s just some Fans of Marnie.

Obviously I want my old favourites back, but at the same time I'm finding some new favourites. The wild area is great, even if it's not the best looking area in the game and is very bare bones in terms of decoration, offering a unique take on Pokemon encounters, and playing with other players is brilliant too. The story and characters definitely aren't bad, but are predictable if you've played Sun and Moon... very obvious inspiration there. The music ranges from the best in the series to this doesn't fit at all, thankfully more good than bad songs. Dynamax and Gigamax forms aren't the silly gimmicks I thought they would be, they offer up some great battles, especially towards the end of the game. And most importantly, unlike Sun and Moon, the game doesn't have a long unnecessary tutorial. Overall, if you want a good Pokemon game, this is for you.

It would be fantastic if the rest of the animations had as much care put into them. -Numerous expansive, empty areas make the game feel hollow.-Areas with many NPCs/things to do are very small in size, and/or extremely linear. -Removed moves for seemingly no reason.-Storyline is the usual; more friendly, and/or pushover rivals.-More Kanto pandering -- a little would be fine, but it's done so frequently now and in the last few gens that you may as well just pick up Red/Blue/Yellow and play those instead.-Pokémon and trainers pop in and out of existence in the Wild Area, akin to an N64 game.-Again, the overworld animations are, without exaggeration, THE worst I have ever seen on a modern console. NPCs and Pokémon spin 180 degrees on their axis to turn; for example, Wingulls hover in mid air without flapping their wings (yet do so just fine in battle). -The entire overworld (Pokémon and NPCs) immediately freeze when doing actions like climbing a ladder.If you really love Pokémon, it plays OK, and the basics are all there. If your favorite Pokémon are in, the culling won't really affect you, but the downsized movepool surely will.

I\\'ve been a huge Pokemon fan since its inception and always dearly loved this series, however the last couple of entries have been getting progressively worse when it came to aspects such as polish, removing features, difficulty, dungeon complexity, post game and many more. My enthusiasm when it came to Pokemon slowly faded away. But I remained hopeful. Afterall Gamefreak promised us that Generation 8 would be \"for the hardcore fans\". And it would be the first mainline game on a home console, a huge step for the series!\\rDespite my initial optimism for these new home console entries I couldn\\'t ignore all the glaring and obvious problems that were observable in all the pre-release material. Graphical quality not even on par with last gen console games, complete lack of care and polish in regards to animation, reusing as many outdated assets as possible; and these were just the issues that were quickly noticeable from a first glance. But the more time passed the worse things got. The removal of basic features like the national dex and the subsequent cutting of over half of all Pokemon was the straw that broke the camel\\'s back.

That makes encounters time wasting grinding. Games can't be entertaining if there's no challenge to them at all.\\rWhat else is it? It is the game with pretty much no story to it. Each and every time stories in Pokemon games are pretty much the same. It doesn't mean it's bad. It just doesn't really evolve into anything. Imagine if TLoZ would repeat A Link To The Past story in every game with some tweaks here and there. It would be just boring. Same as Pokemon games right now.\\rGraphics are not good as well. I'm mostly fine with GF reusing models from previous games. I don't care as long as Pokemon themselves does look good. The problem is everything else. Backgrounds are generally bad. Some textures look like they came from PSX/N64 era (hello trees and ground textures). Animations looks like they are from 2001. Ridiculous pop-ins.\\rAnd these are not all the problems. We also have Dexit, lack of post game, moves cut, lies about animations, lies about models, lies about national dex to Japanese fan base, lack of voice acting, reusing room assets etc.\\rI really want you to think about it: aside from Pokemons what makes you think that these games are good?\",\n",
       "  \"It's a Pokémon game, absolutely 0 special things about it.\\r What was supposed to be the first main game on console is nothing special, that is not good.\\rIt should've been something amazing, but it lacks tonnes of features multiple past 3DS GAMES had.\\r It just falls short and is disappointing.\",\n",
       "  \"In the beginning I was so excited about the upcoming games and the first couple of trailers seemed entertaining both in designs and the future of the game. As the time passed by, I was feeling less and less excited about the game and I will try to summarize the main points after having already finished the game after only 16 hours of gameplay, as an early copy arrived yesterday.\\r Longevity and replay value:\\rFirst of all, compared to previous Pokemon games, only 16 hours of gameplay to beat the whole game seems way underwhelming, especially considering that I caught all the new pokemons that I found, explored the Wild Area and passed through it as many times as deemed possible, as long as there was something interesting to day (Hint: there wasn't much). I feel that except the online component, there isn't much replay value to the games and I don't feel the need to play them again.\\r The price tag: $60 compared to a $40 a couple of years back, for less amount of content seems way overpriced in my eyes.\\r Characters:\\rMost of the in-game characters seem bland, not interesting and especially the rival seems... not like a rival should feel. Even the Champion seems like a naive person the least .\\r Plot:\\rEasy, predictable, no depth, I really wonder if someone thought through the whole story from the beginning or was creating on the way..\\r Difficulty:\\rIt is a pokemon game, I do not expect to have actual difficulties from a game designed also for children and here is the main point, mario odyssey is also designed for children and everyone can complete the game, but it also have more content, targeted on more mature audience with an actual difficulty to complete 100% of all the game aspects. There is no such option in this pokemon game. Exp.Share gets OP and all my pokemon are overleveled, even after switching all the overleveled ones mid-game.\\rOn the other hand, handholding and cutscenes in every route does not make me feel and experience the map as it should be and there is always someone telling me where to go, who to speak to and how to handle every aspect of the game without me feeling responsible for the decisions made in game at any level.\\r Graphics:\\rGraphics don't seem like an upscale compared to previous 3ds games and for being the first mainline game in a console, I would expect something better, for example natural-moving characters or introducing pre-rendered movie scenes in times where the movement seems unnatural (e.g. when the 2 legendaries turn around when they face each other). To get it even a notch further, voice acting in a mainline console gaming doesn't seem far fetched but they didn't even cover the basics so, that is too much to expect from what they have given us.\\r Controversy:\\rI am not gonna use any buzzwords, I totally understand about large number of designs logistics and that doesn't hinder my ability to play the game, so all the other reasons are why I give such a low score for the game.\\r All in all:\\rA pokemon game is never gonna be awful, because of the successful formula they have and because of the size of the franchise, but the way the company is going, we are never gonna have a truly great Pokemon game ever again (eg. HG/SS, Platinum, Emerald, B2/W2).\\r It is not a 0, but anything above a 2 would be unfair, so my score is gonna be exactly that.\",\n",
       "  \"As somebody who has played this I can tell you it is not worth the buy. Especially at full price. It honestly is worse than previous installments in the series and fails to make use of the better hardware available in the form of the switch. Honestly if you want a Pokemon game on the switch play Let's Go. It somehow manages to be better than this. Story was uninspired and boring. Way too much handholding. No challenge and it results in a boring game. Camp was neat but felt like a mediocre version of Amie New Pokemon are kinda cool. Happy with the scorbunny line personallyGraphics look worse than a Nintendo 64 game. Some lag. More than I would expect. Pop in is terrible. Makes the overworld pointless Characters are rehashed or not at all interestingAnimations look like a pitch somebody gave to an animator but the animator died before fixing themThe list of removed features were not improved upon or replaced. Dynamaxing was uninspired and often made the models look worse. Absolutely not worth the cost of the game. Fails to make use of the switch hardware. Game freak continues to fail to listen to what people actually want out of the games. It instead delivers poor rushed games that get worse with every installment\",\n",
       "  \"So I've played at least 10 hours of this and I can't believe this is what was released as the next mainline game of Pokémon.There is little good with this game, while many of the towns do look good and there have been graphical improvements, sadly everything else is just bad. Awful animations that don't belong in a game of this calibre. Removed features once again. The insane amount of hand holding that has been a staple since generation 7.The railroad gameplay is mind numbing with characters consistently popping in and laying a load of text upon you with no freedom to play the game as an RPG. The wild area is boring fast. The new gimmick is stupid and makes me wonder why they removed Megas for this. The main good thing about this game is the core gameplay, because it's a Pokémon game so it's still the exact same that's been loved for twenty years without changing. But it needs to change, Pokémon deserves more than this, and a more expensive game should turn people away.\",\n",

       "  \"I've been a fan of Pokemon since I was a kid. The decline of quality of the games since the jump to 3D has been pretty astounding; between the overwhelming majority of my favourite Pokemon being cut, to the abismal excuse for graphics, to the terrible writing, to no post game, to the sheer amount of glitches, I find myself conflicted between giving this a higher rating simply due to it being a Pokemon game and giving it a 0 to indicate the lowest point in the series. I even made this account just to indicate to the torn users that this is not worth the price.\",\n",
       "  'In my opinion, Sword/Shield is weaker than all previous Pokemon games in practically every aspect. There\\'s so many different ways you can look at this game and no matter what it always falls short compared to previous entries.\\r Length-wise the game is short, you could potentially beat the main story in one sitting. It still feels like you\\'re playing a handheld game made to be played in short bursts rather than a huge home console game. While this is mostly due to the story\\'s actual length, I\\'d say the blame also falls partially on the difficulty. I understand that mainline Pokemon games have never really been hard, but this game takes it to another level. In my experience, it felt as though you would have to be constantly going out of your way to gimp yourself to bring any sense of challenge at all. Playing through the game \"normally\" felt absolutely brainless this time. The post-game content is also what has now become the standard barren experience we\\'ve seen in the past couple of generations. There\\'s the usual short story expansion and Battle Tower. It seems to mostly exist just to nudge players toward online interactions with PvP battles or exploring the Wild Area.\\r The story is nothing special and, in my opinion, weaker than previous entries in the series. It feels like the developers weren\\'t sure what to do and ended up creating a sort of caricature of past Pokemon stories. Just your standard Pokemon story but with completely ridiculous villains, even for what would be considered the \"norm\" for Pokemon. I thought the post-game story\\'s plot and villains actually had potential, but they\\'re obviously only around for a short while and thing wrap up way too soon.\\r Presentation might be where this game hurts the most. As far as Graphics go the game will bounce from looking amazing to looking like a middling budget Gamecube title. Major story moments look mostly great but then something like wild area is just the polar opposite. Music in this entry is incredibly weak compared to previous entries in my opinion. So many songs are just grating to me and very few stick out. The average Pokemon game doesn\\'t wow me with its music, but it\\'s never been outright bad like in Sword/Shield at times. One sort of small aspect of the presentation that really bothers me is the how battles look. Pokemon are still poorly scaled like they were in battles in other 3D entries. In extreme scenarios like with Waillord this looks completely ridiculous. The majority of Pokemon are still animated to look totally lifeless which is jarring when compared to many of the new, pretty animations given to the moves themselves. Battle issues don\\'t just stop at the Pokemon, I would describe the trainers as robotic in battles outside of scripted scenes. They just stand around and won\\'t react to their Pokemon getting hurt or anything. All of these roll together to make battles feel as far from immersive as possible; they feel closer to simulations of Pokemon battles than actual Pokemon battles.\\r The design of the world as a whole I would just say is okay. Towns look pretty and are well-made but are generally lacking in depth which leads to exploring them not feeling very fun. Routes and dungeons, however, are much worse. They\\'re incredibly simplistic and railroaded this time, which leads to very little exploration. If a player wants to explore, the only option is really the Wild Area. Running around in the Wild Area can be fun, but it feels pretty empty and a bit too large for its own good. The world itself is just okay at best, but I was mostly satisfied with the characters in it. Most of the NPCs in the region look nice but don\\'t feel particularly active in the overworld. The new Pokemon of this region are mostly great, but that\\'s obviously to be expected. My favourites are probably the new fossil Pokemon.\\r I\\'d say the new major additions this game brings to the table are a mixed bag. The Wild Area is a great concept, but it ends up feeling empty and what I\\'d describe as tech demo-like. Pokemon Camp is a big letdown in my opinion. It\\'s this entry\\'s version of Pokemon Amie and Refresh but it doesn\\'t do much new. Just the usual interacting with Pokemon except now you have multiple (awkwardly) walking around at once and can play with a ball. The QoL changes are pretty great, however. With nature mints and the ability to breed egg moves onto existing Pokemon you can now take any Pokemon and make it competitively viable. This means you can eventually take Pokemon you had with you through a single player adventure into online competitive battles with almost no downside. The issue, of course, is that these additions come with the trade off of other major features being removed. In particular, the game\\'s lack of the GTS is just insulting.\\r Overall, I see Sword/Shield as easily the weakest mainline Pokemon game. If you skipped out on past Pokemon games I\\'d recommend you look there for a Pokemon fix before even thinking about this game.',\n",
       "  \"Story wise, it's extremely forgettable and unoriginal. This is the most generic and uncreative Pokemon story next to X/Y. The story in this game, brings nothing new to the franchise, it's literally the same boring story that Gamefreak keeps repeating. Compared to the other games that have an interesting story like in Gen 4 and Gen 5...this game brings nothing new or anything interesting to the Pokemon world or lore. It's literally, and I mean LITERALLY just fight the gym leaders, reach to the tournament, get interrupted by the villain and you need to stop the strong/legendary Pokemon that just popped up out of nowhere. This with maybe 3 scenes of exposition coming from Sonia...that's the story of Pokemon Sword/Shield from what I played. Like, the developers didn't even bother showing us a cutscene of how the strong/legendary Pokemon appeared or came.\\r Character wise, none of them really stand out from the rest of the series because of how uncreative or poorly they were written. Your rival Hop is the most annoying rival up to date, who literally stops your path every 5 minutes and wastes your time and repeats the same sentence, “I ShOuLd HaVe KnOwN yOu HaVe MaStErEd TyPiNg”. It doesn't help that is character goes literally everywhere throughout the story, from wanting to be the Champion, to feeling weak after losing to Bede, to wanting to be a professor...BUT still challenges you at the Champion Cup after beating the main game. Rose being the villain of the story is extremely rushed and comes out of nowhere. Yes, we knew he was the villain before the game was released, but his reveal of being a villain LITERALLY comes up in the very last second of the game for no reason what's so ever. Bede was such a disappointment because while he's an actual rude rival like we always wanted, but sadly his team is complete joke because of how pathetic easy they are too beat. The first half of the game, all his Pokemon are ALL Psychic type and the second half of the game, they are ALL Fairy type. Marnie...she's just there in the game for some reason. She literally has no impact to the actual story in the game. Team Yell...give them a medal for being the worst evil organization in the entire Pokemon franchise. You can't take them seriously, they're simply annoying, There's literally nothing interesting or unique about Team Yell.\\r Gameplay wise, it's LITERALLY the exact same battle animations from X/Y, except that they introduced Gigantamax and Dynamax which is easily the worst mechanic compared to Mega Evolutions and Z-Moves. Not only is it broken and really unbalanced, but it was poorly designed with how you obtain a Gigantamax Pokemon.  Unlike Z-Moves or Mega-Evolutions, where you can simply use the require item on the Pokemon you already have and raised…In Sword/Shield, you need to replace and catch the same Pokemon again when it’s in its Gigantamax form. So that Rookidee that you caught at the beginning of the game and bonded with it till it became a Corviknight…throw it in the PC because it won’t be able to Gigantamax. The Wild Area and the Max Raids battles…oh my God, it’s awful. The Wild Area has ugly textures, terrible pop-in and the fps drops like crazy when online. Coming from the biggest media franchise of all time…the Wild Area simply looks unacceptable. It doesn’t help that the Wild Area is introduced way too early in the game and you have no reason whatsoever to go back to it after the first time. The Max Raids battle on the other hand, when offline, are broken. You might battle and want to catch a 5-star Gigantamax Charizard…but the NPC trainers, that are your teammates, are using a Togepi or a Magikarp. Yup, because that makes sense when you’re battling against a giant Level 60 Charizard.\\r Finally, the game lacks content. Not just the National Dex, I’m taking about the extra content that game offers. I mean, the fact that Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver or Pokemon Black 2/White 2 (2 DS games) or even Pokemon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon (a 3DS game) have more content and have more duration than a Nintendo Switch game (which remember, being charged full price)...is pathetic on Gamefreak. The Post-game shouldn’t even be considered a Post-Game because all you are doing is literally catch the legendary Pokemon from the box art, which from all the previous titles, were in the MAIN game. Even the DLC is not enough because the Isle of Armor expansion is terrible.\\r The only good thing that I can say about this game is the Crown Tundra (which has a better and more interesting story btw), the soundtrack and the gym battles actually feel like an exciting event. it felt like something that's actually grand and important like in the anime. But other than that...This is easily one of the worst Pokemon games. I can't argue against people who dislike Pokemon games because this game...is everything that shows why people hate/dislike Pokemon games\"]}"

Soundtrack is amazing, but that was expected. I like how Campaign somehow manages to have vibes from Halo 1, Halo 3 and Halo 4. Amazing voice acting from whole cast, but, particularly from new Cortana (Weapon). Boss fights have never been strong point of Halo, but Infinite pretty much fixes that problem. Multiplayer is great, but needs lots of improvements. Overall, it's easily best shooter of 2021, that also has solid story.\",\n",

Love it. And my favorite: the big boss in the little room with one hit kill. Wonderful.\\r Story is ok i guess, but it just starts when game ends\\r And the Bad Guy... omg... it\\'s even less then onedimensional...

       "  'Pros:\\r * Graphics / lighting effects inside ships is fantastic.\\r* Combat is quite fun - they\\'ve added in some explosion effects with certain types of explosive environmental objects you can toss at enemies which is very enjoyable.\\r* They have added some modules for the suit that you can utilize which are quite well-done. Some are already on the suit at the start (grappling hook), and others you pick up along the way during the narrative.\\r* The Masterchief is still the man and I love that. Fan service is a good thing, that\\'s why franchises have fans.\\r* Interior corridor levels are pretty enjoyable and definitely remind me of the better / earlier Halo games. Open world combat kinda sucks though as ranged combat was never really a strength of the Halo games outside of some good ol\\' Hoggin\\'.\\r Cons:\\r * Haven\\'t decided yet how I feel about the open world nature of the game once you get out into the open, kinda mixed I guess. I feel like the whole open world map bit is pretty over-done and tiresome at this point. I\\'ve never been one to complain about linear games, I find them fun, one of the reasons I thought the first Halo game was so good was it\\'s simplistic approach to storytelling and combat - the combat was just...fun. And you could mostly just run around figuring out how to get a jump on the enemy, throw grenades and shoot them. Don\\'t need all the maps, etc. added in.\\r* Texture quality, particularly outside / at long range is kinda middling, and I have all the graphics turned up as high as they can be turned up in 4k.\\r* Cortana\\'s appearance - like Halo 5, they\\'ve got her wearing some goofy outfit - Cortana is supposed to be female form moving data - it\\'s like they\\'re afraid of the female form or something. She also walks and moves like a dude now for some odd reason. The Halo 4 Cortana was by far the best version of her - very feminine but you had nothing but respect for her and her relationship with John was very well-developed. I suspect a woke agenda is afoot on this one.\\r* The \"Weapon\" - simplified down to \"Counterfeit Cortana\" - your new AI that\\'s basically a poor immitation of Cortana in both appearance and personality. Very annoying personality and dialogue. The last game we got the real Cortana in was Halo 4, which I really enjoyed - loved the development of the relationship dynamic in that game between Master Chief & Cortana, and the development there so far seems to be completely thrown away which is disappointing. Everytime Counterfeit Cortana is onscreen I feel like 343 is trolling me deliberately.\\r* Boss battles are absolutely awful.\\r*  Bad narrative regarding the way they have handled Cortana in both Halo 5 and into Infinite - they\\'ve basically ruined her character and wrecked the franchise - the \"Counterfeit Cortana\" they basically replace the real Cortana with is an insufferable bad joke. 343 is now 0 for 2 on Halo campaign games. I\\'m thankful I never paid for copies of either games and just played them at friends\\' houses. I own Halo 4 and everything before it, but will never purchase Halo 5 or Halo Infinite due to how disrespectful 343 has been to Cortana\\'s character. I remember hearing about all kinds of development issues with Halo Infinite and it\\'s not hard to see why. Their entire narrative team needs to be fired and replaced. I have a difficult time even acknowledging Halo 5 and Halo Infinite as in-universe-canon narratively due to how bad they are and just how outright disrespectful they are.\\r Game Length: It didn\\'t have an hour-counter on it, so I\\'m just guessing when I say somewhere in the 25-35 hour range or thereabouts.\\r Final Rating: 3/10. 343 just needs to stop with Halo campaign games at this point. They have proven that the awful Halo 5 wasn\\'t a one-off thing...they are flat out bad at storytelling and with how they handle beloved characters like Cortana. They seemingly get rid of a great character in Cortana and replace her with this pathetic and cheap counterfeit version of her. Very glad I played this somewhere else and never bought it for myself. Never will, with a narrative this poor and so little respect for the characters.\\r Commentary for developer:   (SPOILERS) The way you folks handled Cortana was awful and what I mean by that is eliminating her (not to mention her appearance which was also bad). After Halo 4, you all outright ruined her character with the way you wrote her and then by killing her off, you basically doubled-down on something people hated in Halo 5. At this rate I\\'ll never buy a game from 343 given this level of disrespect toward characters. Feels like Game of Thrones Season 8 all over again.',\n",
       "  'Once again, Halo is absolute garbage. One of the most overrated games of 2021. Even Battlefield 2042 is a better shooter and that says a lot about this game.',\n",
       "  \"I finished playing this campaign yesterday, but I wanted to wait a day before writing this review to make sure my analysis was more grounded. I was massively disappointed in this campaign. The only thing about the experience that makes it salvageable is the core gunplay. It's very polished, and while some weapons are clearly better than others each has a niche it can be useful for.\\r Moving on to the shortcomings. The story is bland and uninteresting. The writers clearly have no idea how to push the story forward, and it becomes more apparent the longer you play. There is a huge reliance on nostalgia and annoying holograms to fill in the blanks for the story when those blanks desperately needed more screen time than what was actually focused on. Killing Cortana offscreen was incredibly dumb, since it wastes all the time spent building up to her conquest during Halo 5. The villain of the story satisfies every cliche you can think of. 95% of his screen time is spent gloating to the Chief about how he has won and that he is big and tough because he beat the UNSC. It gets old very fast.\\r Moving on to the level/world design: it's not that great. Sure, it LOOKS great and the world the Chief explores looks very polished (except for the massive frame drops you'll experience; seriously, the game dropped below 30 FPS at times while I was playing), but there's no substance to anything. You spend way too much of your time just walking from place to place, and the interiors you explore are uninspiring and copy-pasted all throughout the game. There were several times where I wasn't even sure if I was going in the right direction because everything looks the same (despite using the navigation tool). Most of the side activities boil down to 'go to this place and kill this enemy' which is exactly what you do in the main story, so it just comes off as padding.\\r I could go on, but I think I've made my point. In the months leading up to this game's release I was so excited to play this campaign, but I mentally checked out around halfway through and only finished it because I spent $60 and wanted some form of closure however unsatisfying it was. If you haven't bought this game, i strongly recommend waiting for a price drop or getting it through Xbox game pass so you don't have to pay full price for it. This game is incomplete and unsatisfactory, and it is not worth the price tag.\",\n",

       "  'The campaign is fun for what it\\'s worth, but it still has its flaws. Contrary to pretty much every other Halo game besides ODST, there\\'s almost no biome diversity. The entire game either takes place in one of three places - a forest, a Forerunner interior, or a Banished interior. That\\'s it. The previous Halo games had their standard faction interiors and forests, but they also had snow-covered canyons, dark and haunted swamps, desert plateaus, jungles, lakes, sprawling cities, ancient ruins, oceanside vistas and cliffs, islands, winding valleys... there\\'s none of that in Infinite. Nevermind that 90% of the games\\' missions boil down to \"go here, press button, then go there, press another button, then go there, press that button, then fight a boss all while shooting things along the way.\" There\\'s no creative use of vehicles, no creative use of the open map to build compelling and interesting stealth missions, recon objectives, etc. Instead of making HVT\\'s just bosses surrounded by some enemies, why not create a mission that\\'s more elaborate where you have to draw them out of hiding or collect clues as to their location? Capturing FOB\\'s is laughably easy, as each \"base\" is just a single elevated platform with some fancy fabricator crates lining them. Perhaps the worst part is that none of this is replayable, so once you finish the campaign and all the side missions, there\\'s literally nothing to do. Other games like Just Cause allow you to repeat enemy bases and areas. Games like GTA have side activities that can be enjoyed after hitting 100% completion. Infinite has nothing. Again, the campaign is not BAD. It\\'s actually extremely fun to play through! The problem is that once you\\'re done with it, you\\'re REALLY done with it, and there\\'s nothing to keep you coming back to this vast open sandbox space that 343 spent so long building.\\r As for the multiplayer, I\\'m not even going to say whether Infinite\\'s PvP formula is good or bad, as I don\\'t play PvP, so any opinion in that regard is out of my scope. However, I feel perfectly qualified to say that the PvE and progression in multiplayer is pathetic at best. After 20 years, we finally got bots in Halo multiplayer. Unfortunately, unlike other games like CoD: Ghosts and Gears 4/5 that have multiple PvE playlists separated by difficulty levels, Halo: Infinite only has ONE PvE playlist, \"Bot Bootcamp\", which runs on Marine-difficulty - the second-lowest difficulty in the game. As a result, matches feel less like matches and more like racing other players to get the most kills on hapless AI. This quickly gets old and neuters any sense of replayability the playlist would otherwise have if it were populated by bots running on ODST or even Spartan difficulty. I\\'ve played private matches with bots on Spartan difficulty and at that point, it feels like you\\'re up against MLG pros. THAT is a fun and challenging difficulty. Marine is not. This is an easy fix, but I sadly don\\'t think 343 will do it.\\r The progression in this game is truly awful. What\\'s baffling is that 343i already had a GREAT template to go off of with the MCC. It\\'s meritocratic and incredibly rewarding. You can earn more XP by being really good at the game and stomping all over your enemies, but you can also come out of a match with good gains by being a great teammate and racking up Teamwork XP by driving a Warthog for your teammates. Infinite has none of that, and XP per match is strictly capped to fixed payouts with diminishing returns that actively *discourage* extended play sessions. Why in the world is 343 trying their hardest to get people to STOP playing their game?\\r Perhaps the worst part of Infinite (okay, it\\'s DEFINITELY the worst part of Infinite) is its business model. This just might be the most insulting business model I\\'ve ever seen in a full-price AAA game. And don\\'t tell me \"the multiplayer is free\" because anybody who cares about Halo is paying the $60 for the campaign anyway. Cosmetics in this game can ONLY be earned by either buying the battle pass with real money or buying them from the store with real money. That\\'s right, there is currently no way to earn in-game cosmetics with in-game currency. There are a few skin sets you can earn by retrieving collectibles in the campaign, but that\\'s it. The rest is all locked behind an atrociously overpriced paywall. Everything from the prices to the structure of this game\\'s cosmetics is absolutely abhorrent. The current battle pass has a Halo: Reach theme, but instead of including the HAZOP helmet in the battle pass, it\\'s a separate store item with a TWENTY DOLLAR price tag! Twenty dollars! And keep in mind, you can only use it with the Mark V armor core, a system which severely and needlessly hampers customization.\\r Halo Infinite is a 4/10 masquerading as a 10/10 while being defended as at least a 7/10. It\\'s a deeply flawed, mediocre game that will probably only become fun to play a year or two from now when changes are made. Disappointing.',\n",

Most recent FPS games have come out fairly disappointing, but Infinite manages to spice up the FPS genre in a way that new and old fans of Halo will enjoy. In terms of multiplayer, the only thing that is holding it back, in my opinion, is it's introduction of a battle pass system. Every game as of late has implemented a battle pass system, and frankly I find it to be quite annoying, especially looking at how enjoyable unlocks were in Halo Reach. Other than that, there have been issues with Big Team Battle, which hopefully will be solved soon. Now for the campaign, I deeply enjoy the idea of Infinite being an open world game. However, it is filled with repetitive tropes spawning from games like Far Cry, where there are copy and pasted outposts.

The gameplay is fast paced and fluid enough that it\\'s a fun game to sit around and shoot things in the face.  The campaign has unlocks and upgrades that will help you progress.

When it comes to the lore, I can comfortably say I\\'m a bit disappointed.  As a lore buff, I\\'ve read the novels and get really intrigued by all the things lore-wise.  This game took everything it had established in the past few releases (of all media, books, games, movies) and threw it all away.  They scrapped the story that people were hating on instead of trying to finish it out with a better conclusion.  It\\'s not rare for a story to start weak and end strong. In fact I would say many many stories start out a bit weak compared to where its leading.  Instead of trying to finish strong, they just... didn\\'t finish and started again.  Both of the enemies I was expecting to battle against are gone.  All the exciting bits of the story have been skipped over and you start out in a worse position than the last story left you at.  Are ALL of the games going to gave humanity in the toilet only for Master Chief to save everyone?  In fact, they pretty much start you at bare minimum and in the scope of one game expect some kind of revitalized force.  I cant say much more without going into spoilers so ill go into spoilers.  Stop reading here if you wish to remain uninitiated.I expected to be fighting Cortana as the overall threat that needs to be taken care of with The Banished and Atriox as the more present danger.  Instead, in the first hour of the game you learn they\\'re both dead and a new enemy has taken their place.  What?  What happened?  Shouldn\\'t I be playing through the time all of this stuff went down?  Why am I so far out of the know?  What happened to all that build up?  There\\'s just very little pay off.  Now we have a brute that made an appearance in one book and a whole new species.  Humanity was already in bad shape with basically the UNSC Infinity as it\\'s only force.  Then they trash all that in the first 5 minutes too!  What\\'s next, Master Chief is naked and has a BB gun?  The story isn\\'t automatically epic because you start in such a **** position.  I would have much rather had the Infinity as an asset and not just magical plot-armored out the butt Master Chief.  You do know that while Master Chief is good, hes not so much better than any other Spartan II, right?  He\\'s humanities savior because of his one important role in a grand war, not the ONLY person to fight.The game still has a lot of balancing and technical work to be done.  Scaling is a pretty big issue.  I MAXXED my shields first before unlocking anything else.  Despite this, there were still bosses that could one shot me.  Some elites, and sometimes more than one, will chase you down ruthlessly, swinging their swords chopping you to bits.  2 good swings and you\\'re dead.  What are you supposed to do?  You run slower backwards but you have to keep shooting them, which takes FOREVER for them to die.  Same with brute chargers.  Who thought they were a good idea?  The game has a lot of guns... too many.  Then they provide you with all of them before a major battle but if you chose the wrong ones, now you\\'re stuck in the save and have to scurry around and find the weapons you need with a boss that has the potential to one shot you.  The other Halos would make the weapon you should be using obvious by having it laying in the middle of the floor or tucked away within reach.  Even then it wasn\\'t impossible with any other weapon.  I still don\\'t know how to reliably take down hunters.  It\\'s nigh impossible to get around them so you\\'re stuck plugging away at the orange bits you can see.  They will track you despite obstacles and will ALWAYS face you.  They don\\'t melee nearly as much so you can\\'t bait an attack and they spam their gun at close range making it suicide to try anyway.  The back armor breaks off like always, for all the good it will do since you\\'ll never be able to shoot it.  Jackles now have an even smaller bit of their hand sticking out to hit to stagger them and they\\'ll swap positions to the top of the shield too.  In conclusion, it\\'s not a masterpiece, and you may be thrown off by the story, but its still fun to play and mess around with.

I'm usually at around 70-80 fps, but there are a lot of drops below 60 fps as well, despite the fact that I'm using an RTX 3080 card and play at ~1440p with several graphics options lowered from High to Medium.\\r2. No dedicated fullscreen, so you need to choose between windowed mode or borderless. There's also no way for you to alter the internal resolution, so you're forced to either use resolution scaling or change the resolution of the monitor itself.\\r3. The open world feels empty and pointless, since everything looks the same everywhere.\\r4. Only some of the collectibles are marked on the map after clearing outposts, so you'll be looking for needles in a haystack or be forced to use a walkthrough if you want to find the rest of them.\\r5. Some of the collectibles are located in mission areas you can't return to, and since there's also no way to replay missions after they're finished, you're permanently locked out of collecting these items (and thus also 100%ing the game) unless you get them all the first time you play these missions.\\r6. Collectibles you've already picked up still show on the map. You can barely tell them apart from uncollected ones, and there's no way to filter which ones to show.\\r7. Boring story.\\r8. No co-op.\\r9. Awful enemy design. The antagonists look like some sort of space gorillas, with little to no variation from individual to individual, and they all have the same burly voice.\\r10. Bullet sponge enemies. You'll have to unload a whole stream of shots into their unarmored heads for them to die, and even more if you're hitting armor or anywhere else on the body.\\r11. Enemies can kill you in one hit from full HP even on lower difficulties, forcing you to clear out an entire area all over again.\\r12. You randomly fall through the ground of the game world and die.

They are just normal enemies with larger health bars in most cases. Seems like there isn't a technique or much skill involved to defeat them, most times it seems to come down to RnG.\\r - Not shipping with COOP! This is a big one, given it's a halo staple.\\r - Not enough ammo / enemies with too much health, you find yourself in a constant struggle of not having ammo and having to constantly pick weapons up that often suck. That and getting locked into linear parts of the game with garbage weapons.\\r Lots of potential but just doesn't feel quite there...

It was great when it first came out, I loved it. It had its flaws like any other game, but it was still Halo and I just expected that 343 would be active in communicating with their community and fixing issues with the game. Fast forward 4 months, and I can honestly say, I could not have possibly been more wrong. 343 still, as of right now (March), has essentially done nothing whatsoever to fix their game, let alone, added any content besides the occasional new, and usually awful, temporary game mode! Don\\'t worry though everybody, the battle pass is still getting a weekly update by these awesome developers. You know? The thing that they charge their fans $10 a month for? All for items that should be free, and made Halo so much fun to play 10 years ago? Look, I understand that the game is free, and the battle pass is how they make their money, but the fact that the battle pass is more polished than the actual game itself is downright comical. It\\'s almost like they said: \"The game isn\\'t finished, but I want money, so let\\'s make the battle pass, and release it before Christmas because we know parents are gonna buy it for their kids, and then after that, we can go on vacation for four months.\" All jokes aside, I will say, Covid has been a big issue for companies, especially 343. Totally understandable, I also can only program games in an office setting, and could never do so at my house, especially with Covid and its cyberattack tendencies. Apparently, Covid has been actively targeting and attacking the routers at the homes of the developers of 343.  Scary stuff.

       "  'En esta nueva entrega donde 343 Industries presume de una nueva Era de Halo y el Halo más ambicioso ,vemos un gran intento de regresar a sus inicios y reconquistar a sus fans y por fin crear un Halo a la altura de la trilogía original.Pero la gran interrogante  ¿LO LOGRARON?Les adelanto , No realmente.Antes que nada me gustaría hablar un poco de  Halo Wars 2 ya que es mi juego de 343 Industries favorito. Para muchos no fue de lo más popular ,en mi opinión ha sido lo más cercano que 343 posiblemente estará con los juegos originales.Ya que cuenta con un estilo de arte impecable que evoluciona el arte de Bungie,lleva la narrativa a un ambiente épico con personajes refrescantes,el increíble regreso de El Flood ,una historia emocionante\\xa0 y un Villano a la altura de lo que merece la franquicia.Cuatro años después se anuncia la nueva entrega de Halo protagonizada por el Jefe Maestro ,Halo infinite donde se presume de un mundo semiabierto ,un anillo misterioso y un Soft-Reboot de la serie.En 2020 el tráiler que propuso el meme de \"Craig\" dado a la deficiencia de calidad gráfica del videojuego , provocó su retraso 12 meses así llegando hasta el 8 de Diciembre del 2021.Unas semanas antes del estreno se lanzó el Multiplayer Free to Play de Halo Infinite bajo la categoría de Versión \"Beta\" dónde si el gameplay se sentía solido y bastante parecido a la trilogía original pero la esencia de Bungie en el \"Gunplay\" es irremplazable.Se lanzó con muchos problemas de Monetización agresiva ,falta de variedad de listas de juego ,escasez\\xa0 de armas icónicas , un sistema de Personalización y Progresión muy limitante .Llegando el día de estreno oficial se lanzó el modo historia de Halo Infinite donde por fin se reveló la verdad sobre el título.La historia comienza donde Atriox arrasa la UNSC Infinity junto con el Jefe Maestro en menos de 4 minutos , dejando vivo al Jefe a Merced de la oscuridad del espacio profundo.Más tarde \"el piloto\" lo rescata del limbo espacial así comenzando la historia.Resulta que las Fuerzas de los Desterrados controlan el anillo dónde una parte fue destruida a razón del sacrificio de Cortana con el propósito de detener y remendar su pasado erróneo a manos de los Desterrados así impidiendo la activación de Zeta Halo\\xa0 unos 6 meses antes del presente.El trabajo de John 117 es liberar el anillo de las fuerzas Desterradas e impedir la reconstrucción del mismo encontrándose con amenazas potenciales de \"la mano de Atriox\" y un nuevo personaje conocido como\"El Heraldo de la Verdad\".El sistema de juego me pareció particularmente divertido e interesante ya que contamos con un conjunto de habilidades que se pueden mejorar\\xa0 \\xa0conforme vayamos liberando y rescatando el terreno del anillo en favor de la humanidad.Pero aquí viene el gran pero y el punto agrio del título ,la historia ; Carece de un gran desarrollo argumental dónde los personajes no llevan a ningún lado ,no hay una profundidad narrativa dónde que lleven a emociones como tristeza , angustia, enojo etc.En su mayoría trata de el piloto y un cierre más dónde la muerte de Cortana ocurre .Los personajes nuevos como Escharum ,sus secuaces y El Heraldo se ven prontamente desaprovechados y eliminados por su muerte.La historia se siente como un gran potencial de los villanos sin motivos de peso y\\xa0 tirados a la basura, dónde el final habla de \"Los Eternos \" .Una raza Nueva que sin motivos ni información aparente son revividos por parte de un Atriox superviviente y nos dicen que es peor que el \"Flood\".En mi opinión está historia ha sido de las más planas, poco desarrolladas\\xa0 y más aburridas de la época 343 Industries, una verdadera decepción que lleva solamente a posibles Dlc\\'s de pago para Halo Infinite en su plan de 10 años como juego de servicio copiando el modelo de Destiny de mal manera y faltando el gran aspecto mmo RPG con el que cuenta dicho título.En conclusión Halo Infinite es una De-Evolucion en la calidad de la franquicia ,que propone un gameplay divertido ,una historia de la más simplona , aburrida y que menos aporta a la franquicia, una dirección de arte muy deficiente dónde todo se ve aparentemente bien pero con una gran carencia de realismo y pésima iluminación,dónde se asemeja con títulos como Fortnite ,que se ven caricaturezcos y nítidos .Un mundo semiabierto muy poco desarrollado, inconsistente,sin ser para nada interactivo ni reaccionante\\xa0 ,incompleto y repetitivo.Un intento nostálgico que lleva a la mediocridad del potencial Infinito que pudo ser el mejor Halo y la redención de 343 Industries .Me duele mucho decir esto ya que soy un fan desde Halo CE he jugado y atesorado todos los\\xa0 juegos de halo .Pero después de esto y de que no se dieron cuenta de que Halo Wars 2 fue posiblemente su mejor intento hacia la perfección y real evolución . como dirían de meme pero es la realidad :HALO MURIÓ EN REACH.',\n",

The single player campaign is a 6/10 for me.  The first hour or so before you get into the open world is a boring slog.  Some of it looks good but some of it looks really bad.  The animations on some of the enemies looks good but the cutscenes are pretty horrible.  The main bad guy is cliche and seems very one dimensional.  I don't really care about his threats, who he is, or anything about him.\\r Once you get outside it does get better but it is just not that great.  The open world looks okay but things in the distance look bad, some of the effects are terrible (tire tracks), and it just looks like a game from 4 years ago.  I also find pilot annoying, he just complains the whole time and the open world is just okay.  When I'm playing it I just keep thinking is this game better than other open world FPS games and I keep coming back to the same answer, no.  It doesn't look better, the world isn't better, the story is weak, etc.  If it wasn't Master Chief I think people wouldn't be giving this game anything above an 8, the nostalgia is definitely boosting a lot of these scores.\\r I would say if you aren't invested n the Halo universe then you're not going to love this game.

If you\\'re a long-time Halo fan hoping for a return to form than you may be disappointed.\\r I genuinely did enjoy a lot of my time with Halo Infinite, but the moment I realized I was about to start the final mission of the game I realized that this game was never going to capture the essence of the series it claimed it would, honestly I don\\'t think they were ever trying to.\\r Halo Infinite is a step up from 343\\'s last title, but at the end of the day it still falls victim to all of the studio\\'s shortcomings; and despite the return of the classic artstyle, this is arguably the least \"Halo-like\" game in the series.\\r Every installment in this series since Reach has strayed further away from the original formula, which makes sense since the games are now being made by different creatives and developers. However this game\\'s jump to the Open World format, along with many different gameplay and direction decisions takes it beyond just a different take on the series and ultimately makes it feel more like its own IP, vaguely inspired by Halo.\\r A common criticism I\\'ve had with Post Bungie halo games is that it feels like the developers are overthinking which direction to take them. In my opinion, Halo\\'s greatest strength has always come from being accessible yet rewarding experience; feeling immediately comprehensible for new players yet having the mechanical depth to still have a pretty high skill ceiling (In both single and Multiplayer). Halo Infinite, however, Has so many mechanics and systems at play that, while not overwhelming, that sense of accessibility feels lost. With the entire game world being saturated with specific damage-type explosive barrels and identical bases to capture and operate; then populated with so many variants of the same enemy that it\\'s hard to tell which rank each variant is, the game effectively trades all immersion for constant reminders that the skill ceiling exists and if you\\'re new you know how bad you are.\\r The core gameplay is fun, but almost completely devoid of Halo\\'s key elements. Every weapon has hard scoping, sprinting and Doom Eternal style movement mechanics are necessary to get around and battle tougher enemies, You can refill an alien weapon\\'s ammo without finding a new one, and the actual tradeoffs between damage types has been minimized, with all weapons, even automatic and plasma guns doing head-shot damage. All these little changes don\\'t need to be bad on their own, but they add up and  ultimately make the gameplay feel too generic and like anything else you\\'d get from any other Triple A studio these days.\\r Even the actual way the Universe is explored through the game feels lacking. In previous games each faction felt distinctive in their appearance and weapons, but in Infinite not only is there very little visual identity between the weapons of each faction, but enemies will some-what frequently use UNSC weapons against you, making the banished feel far less distinctive as an enemy than the covenant did. All this alongside all weapons having headshot damage and reloading makes them all feel too similar.\\r The Story and campaign rivals Halo 5 in narrative failure. The story isn\\'t nearly as frustrating to sit through, but it is arguably worse in that nothing really happens, yet plot-lines and characters are buried so that they can\\'t even be revisited. Without spoiling anything, very few characters from previous games appear in Infinite, the closest we get to representation from any pre-existing supporting cast are some collectable audio files. Worse yet, major storylines are entirely resolved off-screen, while the main campaign takes the player through dull objective after dull objective, with actually essential information to the plot being deeply confusing and largely reliant on the player collecting hidden audio files to make even a little sense.\\r All around Halo Infinite is a perfectly fine open world action game; but as a Halo game it fails spectacularly, and strongly suggests the devs at 343 would be more comfortable making their own IP than trying to modernize Halo. While as a longtime fan I have almost nothing positive to say about it, I won\\'t rate this any lower than a 7 because the game does very little \"wrong\" from an independent design perspective. It merely fails to revive the franchise it promised it would.',\n",

They assume you have a deeper understanding of the lore and don't bother explaining too much. Seems to be many bugs and the new engine does really present itself as next gen.

       "  \"Play on legendary. Gunplay is amazing, games run smoothly on my PC no problem. The enemies are challenging and I love how all the weapons were useable. Boss battles were a letdown because they were fairly easy. The open-world was a lot of fun need to go back and finish clearing the banish from zeta halo. Not a perfect game but it's fun and I recommend you give it a try.\",\n",
       "  'Like every other Halo Game, absolutely generic, boring, crap/childy enemy designs and totaly overrated.',\n",
       "  \"The best part of Halo. Before the release of the Master Chief Collection on PC, I was not familiar with the Halo series.\\rBut now I'm a fan.\\rPhil Spencer stoit i ebet.\",\n",
       "  'The narrative is pretty lacking, I can\\'t believe they killed a major character off-screen and passed it off as acceptable story telling. They introduce a new \"race\" that we do not know anything about and remains unexplained for the entirety of the story before she is finished off by chief and finally who are the banished? Do you need to read/play every spin-off media that is made for Halo to get a good story experience out of a Halo game these days? No yikes this games narrative is rough as hell. At no point was I at the edge of my seat because of the narrative. Also very disappointing is the loss of excellent cinematography in the cutscenes that even Halo 4 & 5 had. This was a staple of the series, but cutscenes are Infinite are extremely barebones. There were some interesting shots, but you can count them on one hand.\\r The sound design is excellent, but most of the original music is not memorable. Relying on the original trilogy music feels kind of desperate, but objectively that music is good.\\r As for the gameplay and open world. The gameplay is perfectly serviceable, the grappling hook is introduced and feels pretty useful in combat. I did not care for the Far Cry-esque open world map markers and outposts and basically skipped all of them. Getting from story mission A to story mission B basically equaled to just finding a vehicle and driving for 5 minutes. The open world therefore is more of a detriment if you liked the older Halo titles (CE, 2, 3, Reach), and the fact that world consists of solely trees, hills and grass doesn\\'t do it any favours. Sometimes you are thrown into forerunner structures, but they get pretty samey after a while and look like copy-paste jobs.\\r It\\'s definitely an improvement over Halo 4/5 in terms of gameplay but the narrative is just as lacking as Halo 5. It\\'s narrative is worse than Halo 4 though.\\r grievances: The bosses are just regular enemies with more health (aka bullet sponges). The intro cutscene goes unexplained and none of the characters are known or met in the game itself (who the hell is Atriox?). Cutscenes are way too long, and interrupt gameplay too much early on in the game. The facial expressions of The Weapon are hilariously bad and distracting, and the fact that she is a copy of Cortana can be seen coming from a mile away. Checkpoints are basically existing in a semi-state of permanence, they exist as long as the game session lasts. It is never made clear when it is safe to turn off the game and know that mission progress will be saved.',\n",
       "  'The actual gameplay is great. Short of that, the game is disappointing. Campaign is missing all the set pieces that made halo great, and the story is a confusing jumble. Multiplayer is structured around buying in game currency for cosmetics, and is lacking some really basic game modes. As a halo player since the original, im worried about the direction the series has taken.']}"
