# DB_Project

NOTE: This will NOT run if you just pull and initialize it. You will need to set up a local database connection, and change the "SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI" argument inside "gamestats.py" in order to run it properly.

This Project was done for my NYU Database Systems Class.


## Software and Languages used:
Website: Flask (Python), SQLAlchemy \
Database: Microsoft SQL Server Express (64-bit) \
Database Manager: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio \
Machine Learning Algorithm: Pytorch, kmeans_pytorch \
Machine Learning Data: Mockaroo

## Purpose
This is an integration of a game recommender and statistics tracker, originally starting with the model for the relational database that would house the statisical data for a user. This project has two parts, the first demonstrates that it can pull directly from a physical database. The second demonstrates a simple evaluator for input data using a simple K-Means clustering model.
